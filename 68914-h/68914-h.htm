<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> suppose</span> there is no man who would care to
have sunlight in all his life; but I hardly
think there is one who could have sunk to the
deep as I did, and yet have been coward enough
to live, as I do&mdash;I, Gaspard de Vibrac.</p>

<p>As I write these lines in my study in lonely
Vibrac, the four white stars on my shield, carved
in relief above the fireplace, seem to burn red with
the memory of my shame, and nothing can wipe
out that stain in my ’scutcheon&mdash;nothing, nothing!</p>

<p>Thank God! I am the last of my house! Thank
God! No young feet patter up and down the
long corridors; no young voices shrill through
these silent rooms. They would grow up to
know me as the “Shame of Vibrac.” The very
villagers, my serfs, dogs, whom I could send to
the <i>carcau</i> with a nod of my head, scowl as they
doff their caps to me, and the children shiver and
shrink behind their mothers’ skirts on those rare
occasions when I come out of the château. I suppose
they know the story&mdash;and I live!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>And is this the pity of God? He has spared my
life. Good men, honorable gentlemen, my friends&mdash;I
had such friends once&mdash;have died like vermin.
The Lake of Geneva holds all that is left of Maligny,
<i>le beau cadet</i>, as we called him; the Vidame
died at the galleys, chained to the scum of mankind.
But he died, Maligny died, even Achon died,
that merciless priest! And I live as a leper! I
have come to know that death is the pity of God.</p>

<p>Forty years back there was life and strength, a
hot heart, and no count kept of the score. Since
then I have paid and paid; but the hideous total
of my debt yet looms as large as ever.</p>

<p>As I look back into the past, it seems but as
yesterday to me that gray afternoon, the day following
the St. Germain’s Affair, when Court and
city were alike convulsed with terror at the discovery
of the conspiracy that was to end in the
shambles at Amboise, and I rode from the Louvre,
through the buzzing streets of Paris, to my house
in the Rue Coquillière.</p>

<p>Of course I was hilt deep in the matter, and,
even as I rode, there was a list of names in my
pocket that would have brought the heads of the
owners thereof to the block did but the Cardinal
of Lorraine or Catherine de Medicis cast but an
eye on the scroll. Prudence had counselled me to
leave Paris, as most of the others had done; but
as yet I was sure that the Flies of Guise had not
settled upon me, and again, when a man is four-and-twenty
and in love, prudence is cast to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>four winds of heaven. And so I risked my neck
for a pair of blue eyes, as many another man has
done, and will do, and whilst I rode I placed my
hand at my breast pocket, not to feel if the scroll
of names was safe, but to assure myself that a
letter and a delicate embroidered glove lay there
over my heart. They were there; but even
through my madness I felt a touch of shame, and
my hand dropped to my side, for glove and letter
had come from another man’s wife&mdash;and he was
my friend.</p>

<p>In a few yards I was at my own gates, and
riding into the courtyard, dismounted and hurried
within. I wanted to gaze upon the glove again,
to read the letter once more, and to think&mdash;if ever
man had need for reflection I had then.</p>

<p>In my study I found Majolais, the dumb, black
dwarf, whom I had purchased as a gift for the
Princess of Condé. He lay asleep, with his head,
hideous as that of a gargoyle, resting upon a
cushion of yellow satin. Ringing for my equerry,
I gave orders for the dwarf to be sent at once to
the Princess, and it took two men to remove him,
for the creature seemed to have become attached
to me in a strange, wild way, and fought like a
mad thing to gain my side, uttering strange
sounds from his tongueless throat as he struggled
with a wonderful strength to gain my side.</p>

<p>At last, however, he was taken away, and I was
alone. Flinging myself into a chair by the window
I took out the glove and the letter. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>glove I kissed and placed on a table beside me,
and the letter I read again and again.</p>

<p>It was a mad, pitiful letter, and in the blurred
and hasty lines were words that could only have
been written by a woman who for the moment
had lost all power of reason, and was ready to
leap into the abyss from which there is no return.
I will speak no more of it. I should have
destroyed it then and there, but that I too had
lost all control over myself, and for the sake of
Marie de Marcilly was ready to deceive my friend
and beggar myself of my honor. When I thought
of her and her unhappiness all thought of Jean de
Marcilly was lost, although I had first seen war
under him at the Escaillon and at Renty, though
we had ridden side by side, the day he took “The
Emperor’s Pistols,” though he had saved my life
in the trenches before Thionville&mdash;though, in
short, he was a brave and noble gentleman and
my friend. At that moment, however, he was to
me the man who stood between me and my love.
I had not reached this stage at once. I had
fought and struggled with myself and lost. And
now I was ready to take the downward steps to
guilt, and descending is always easy.</p>

<p>It was in this frame of mind that I slowly
folded the letter and put it back when the door
opened, and Badehorn, my equerry, a stolid German,
stepped in.</p>

<p>“A lady to see monsieur.”</p>

<p>“A lady!” I half stammered, rising from my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>chair, with the wildest thoughts running through
my mind.</p>

<p>“Monsieur!”</p>

<p>“Show her in, please,” I said, my voice shaking,
my hands stone-cold. Badehorn bowed and retired.
For an instant I stood in breathless expectation,
then the door opened again, and the
woman I loved stood before me.</p>

<p>I can see her now as in a mirror, tall and
slight, with the fair hair and blue eyes that came
to her from her English mother. The hood of the
long, gray cloak she wore was thrown back, her
cheeks were pale and the red gone out of the perfect
bow of her lips.</p>

<p>“Madame,” I began, hardly knowing what to
say; but she came forward with hasty steps.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac&mdash;I have come to warn you.
You are amongst the suspected&mdash;you must leave
Paris at once.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac,” I repeated a little bitterly;
but she took no notice, and continued in the
same quick, hurried manner.</p>

<p>“Go! I implore you! Go! It will be too late
to-morrow. They have taken the Vidame, and
my&mdash;my husband has fled.”</p>

<p>“Marcilly gone! And left you!”</p>

<p>A rush of color came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I warned him. It was the merest chance that
I found out&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She made no answer, and then, with the room
swimming around me, I dropped on my knee before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
her, and, taking her hand&mdash;it was as cold as
mine&mdash;pleaded with all my soul.</p>

<p>“Madame! I have got your letter, and I know
now all your unhappiness&mdash;and I know, too, another
thing&mdash;else you had not come here to save
my life. Oh, Madame!” And rising, I stood beside
her. “The world is not made for sorrow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are mad,” she murmured, but her hand
still lay in mine. I was mad, and she spoke the
truth, and the desperate words burst from me.</p>

<p>“Marie, I love you. Come with me, and let us end
this life of misery for you and for me. You love me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have never said so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Does man or woman ever need to be told that,
Marie? You have saved my life. Let me devote
that life to you, and give you life and happiness.
I will leave Paris to-night. There is a wicket
gate in the gardens of the Louvre beyond the riding
school. I have the key. Meet me there at
compline, and when the sun rises to-morrow we
will be safe from pursuit, and then, Marie&mdash;and
then&mdash;happiness for you and for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I stopped, for her face was as marble, and with
a shiver she murmured to herself,</p>

<p>“What shall I do? What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Marie!” I began; but she stayed me with a
gesture, and putting her hands on my shoulders,
looked straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Vibrac, you know not what you say. You are
as mad as I am. Think what this will mean to
you and to me! Think what the world will say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“I have thought, and I care not. What is the
world to me, or I to the world? I am not mad.
Let me save you from a life you hate. I will save
you&mdash;there is not one who shall stand between
me and the woman I love.”</p>

<p>“You love?” Her voice was so low the words
might have been a whisper.</p>

<p>“Aye, love! And with a love you do not dream
of, dear.”</p>

<p>“It will spoil your life&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I cannot!”</p>

<p>“Marie! it will make my life&mdash;come!”</p>

<p>She said nothing, but stood still as a stone, her
bosom heaving, and her eyes wet with tears. I
tried to draw her towards me, to kiss her, but
she shrank back.</p>

<p>“Not now,” she whispered, and my arm dropped
to my side, and we stood gazing at each other,
two wandering souls that had passed out into the
unknown seas. At last she spoke again, her
words coming slowly and with an effort.</p>

<p>“You will never regret, Vibrac? Will you?”</p>

<p>“My queen! Can you ask?” And bending low I
touched her hand with my lips. She drew back
once more quickly, and pulling her hood up, held
the folds at her neck with her hand as she
said:</p>

<p>“I must go&mdash;let me go now.”</p>

<p>“Until compline&mdash;and you will be at the wicket
gate?”</p>

<p>She but bent her head in reply, and turned as if
to go. It was at this moment that we heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>voices in the corridor outside, and then a hurried
knocking at the door. Marie ran back to my side
with a little gasp.</p>

<p>“They are come to take you&mdash;oh, Vibrac!”</p>

<p>But there was no tread of spurred heels, no clash
of arms, only that insistent knocking, and then a
voice:</p>

<p>“Vibrac! Vibrac! It is I&mdash;Marcilly!”</p>

<p>We two but glanced at each other, a guilty
shrinking glance. Then springing forward, I
took Marie by the arm, and almost dragged her
across the room to where a curtained archway
separated my study from a dressing-room.</p>

<p>“In there! Quick!” I whispered; “open the door
beyond, and go out by the private way; I will
stop him here.”</p>

<p>She fled through the passage, and letting the
curtain fall I walked up to the door with a trembling
heart, and drew back the bolt, to find Marcilly
before me, with Badehorn standing behind
him, a look of alarm in his face.</p>

<p>“You! In Paris!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not by my own will,” he laughed grimly;
“but, thanks to this dress, I am still safe,” and
then for the first time I noticed that he was clad
in the black and yellow of Guise.</p>

<p>“Let no one interrupt us, Badehorn,” I said;
and with an affected cordiality&mdash;I seemed to learn
without effort to play the hypocrite&mdash;I took Marcilly’s
arm and drew him within whilst he continued
talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“I had this dress ready for an emergency, and
actually helped to batter in my own doors. Then
seeing a chance of getting away I slipped up here,
where I knew I would be safe for an hour or so,”
and with these words he flung himself into the
chair near the window, and began playing with
the glove I had left on the table.</p>

<p>Sick at heart as I was with the fear that he
would recognize the glove, I could not help, even
then, noticing the extraordinary resemblance that
he bore to the Prince of Condé, the secret chief
of our conspiracy, a resemblance that had given
Marcilly the nickname of “The Shadow of Condé.”
And as I stared at him he glanced up at me, running
his eyes over my gay court dress.</p>

<p>“You are safe as yet, I see,” he said, “and have
time for these things,” and he flicked the glove
from side to side.</p>

<p>“I leave Paris to-night. I am no longer
safe.”</p>

<p>“Then we will go together and join the Prince.
It must be open war now. Thank God! The
Cardinal is a poltroon, and has lost his head,
else they would have trapped us like rabbits&mdash;but
there are still some men amongst the Guisards,
and they may be here any moment. Come!”
And he started up, the glove still in his hand.
“Let us be off!”</p>

<p>For an instant I knew not what to say; then
recovering myself with an effort I told him: “I
will meet you at compline&mdash;at the Porte St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>Victor.” It was the gate opposite to that by
which I meant to leave Paris.</p>

<p>“At compline! Between this and compline we
may have lodgings in the Châtelet&mdash;what bee
have you got in your head to stay here now?”</p>

<p>Unconsciously my eyes fell on the glove in his
hand, and following my glance he jumped to a
conclusion.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said with a bitter laugh, “this trifle!
A pretty toy,” and then, looking at it curiously,
“’tis almost small enough to fit her hand.”</p>

<p>Did the man suspect or know? Was he trifling
with me? For the moment I thought he was,
and watched him with a new-born cowardice in
my heart. Even as I did so I thought I heard a
movement in the room within, and glanced round
with a guilty start. Surely Marie had not stayed?
It could not be! And then I turned again to
Marcilly. He had not observed that start and
backward look. He was staring at the glove in
his hand.</p>

<p>“The very perfume she uses,” he murmured to
himself, and, laying the glove gently on the table,
he looked me full in the face, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“I wish you all happiness, Vibrac, if it is as I
think. More happiness than has fallen to me!”</p>

<p>“You! You are the most fortunate of men.”</p>

<p>He laughed shortly and sadly.</p>

<p>“Fortunate! Do you call that man fortunate
who has seen his wife’s love pass from him?”</p>

<p>“Pass from him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Yes! Do you call that man happy who, loving
his wife as I do, sees day by day a gulf opening
between them. Bah! You must have known all
this&mdash;you, and all the rest. Else why do I live in
the Rue Bourgogne and my wife at the Louvre?”</p>

<p>“It will pass away. There must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“It will pass when I die&mdash;and I have sought for
death for long. God knows! I would have let
myself be taken to-day but that she herself wrote
to warn me&mdash;and that letter which I have here”
(he placed his hand to his heart) “has given me
some hope. It came to me like a ray of sunshine&mdash;she
would not have written if she did not care.”</p>

<p>I felt my forehead burn with shame. I was as
yet too new at the game to play the villain without
remorse. For an instant, when I thought of
what this man had been to me, my old leader, my
friend, I saw my infamy in all its meanness, and
I was within an ace of telling him all, and asking
him to slay me where I stood; and then, like
lightning, there came to me the other thought&mdash;no&mdash;I
would not yield her&mdash;for her I would pay
any price. But I could not bear to have the man
before me longer. It was unendurable, and to
cover the expression on my face I stepped to the
window. “It rains,” I said for want of something
to say, and he was by my side in a moment.</p>

<p>“There is nothing like rain to clear the streets
and give us a chance. Let us go now.”</p>

<p>I turned on him almost savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“I have an appointment that I must keep; that
I will keep if I die for it; but you, Marcilly&mdash;why
stay? Outside Paris there is safety, and as you
yourself have said, you have begun to hope again.
There is danger here, but danger that I must face.
Take my advice and go now.”</p>

<p>“I cannot desert you.”</p>

<p>I blazed up in sudden wrath. Would I never be
free of this accusing presence?</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Comte, I have not asked your aid&mdash;my
business is private.”</p>

<p>We stared at each other, surprise and anger in
his glance. For an instant I almost hoped he was
going to draw on me, for there was no more fierce
spirit than Jean de Marcilly; but he controlled
himself with a mighty effort.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Gaspard!” he said, “we are too
old in friendship to quarrel. <i>Au revoir!</i> I will
meet you at the Porte St. Victor.”</p>

<p>“No!” I said, “I cannot promise to be there.
Ride straight from Paris&mdash;go straight to the
Prince. There are blows to be struck. I&mdash;-I will
join you later. But leave me now. This house is
no refuge, and our ways must be separate.”</p>

<p>“I will wait in any case until compline at the
Porte St. Victor,” he repeated, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>I nerved myself to take it, and two minutes
later saw him trot out of the courtyard into the
street.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RUE DES LAVANDIERES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> first thing I did after Marcilly’s departure
was to replace the glove in my pocket,
then I lifted the curtain and walked into my dressing-room.
I had a mad thought that Marie might
still be there. But I was mistaken. The room
was empty. I stepped up to the door leading to
the private passage and tried to open it. It was
locked from the inside and refused to yield. In
her hurry, Marie must have taken the key with
her, and turned it in the lock after her when she
went.</p>

<p>Half unconsciously I leaned against the door,
and, I was sure of it, the faint sound of receding
footsteps came to me from the stairway beyond.
If I heard right she must have waited until the
last moment, and heard every word of what had
passed between her husband and myself&mdash;and&mdash;what
a villain I must have seemed!</p>

<p>I could bear to be there no longer, but hastened
back to the study and rang for Badehorn. He
was faithful and discreet, and I could trust him
with my life.</p>

<p>“Badehorn,” I said when he came, “we must
leave Paris to-night.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Can you get three horses without any one in
the house knowing it?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur has forgotten that there are horses
of his kept ready at Maître Barov’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I grow foolish! Is there one fit for a lady
to ride?”</p>

<p>“There is the gray that Madame de Marcilly
rode&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough! Be in waiting for me with the horses
under the limes, near the riding school of the
Louvre, by nine to-night. I will join you there&mdash;and
Badehorn&mdash;not a word to a soul&mdash;this is life
or death.”</p>

<p>“Does Monsieur mistrust me?”</p>

<p>I looked at the resolute face and honest eyes.
There was no treachery there.</p>

<p>“No, Badehorn&mdash;not you.”</p>

<p>He was sparing of speech, and said nothing;
but his face brightened like that of a faithful dog
caressed by its master, and I went on.</p>

<p>“I am going out now&mdash;on foot&mdash;let it be
thought that I am returning shortly&mdash;give me my
cloak.”</p>

<p>As he helped me on with my cloak, he said,
“Monsieur, Billot has just returned from the
Louvre, and says that they are taking the King
at once to Blois, and that the Cardinal has gone
already.”</p>

<p>“The Cardinal gone?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur&mdash;and the whole place in an uproar.”</p>

<p>“It will give us breathing space, and more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>chance of escape then,” I muttered. Then with a
last word of caution to Badehorn, I left the room,
and walked down the wide stairway I was never
to see again.</p>

<p>Across the flagged courtyard, and into the
street I went, and was soon lost in the throng of
humanity that surged down toward the river face
and the palace. I made no attempt at concealment.
There was concealment enough in being an
atom of that heaving mass, and the eyes would
have been sharp indeed that could have recognized
any one in the streets, where the drizzle blurred
out everything an arm’s length ahead, though
here and there a faint splash of blue in the monotonous
gray overhead showed that it was likely to
clear soon. Under the dripping eaves, beneath the
shelter of the overhanging windows, within and
about the doors of shops and cabarets, groups of
people were assembled, all talking eagerly and in
an excited manner of the events of the past two
days. Despite the rain the streets were crowded
with ever-moving waves of passers-by, and now
and then above the swish of the rain, above the
continuous and insistent hum of voices, one could
hear a shout of “Down with the tiger of Lorraine!”&mdash;a
cry that would be replied to at once
by an answering, “A Guise! A Guise! Death to
the Huguenots!” Then would follow a roar of
many throats that showed that the passions of
the mob were rising to fever heat.</p>

<p>I paid no attention, however, to what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>passing, but went steadily onward toward the
Rue des Lavandières. In that quiet street was an
inn, kept by one who was a secret agent of our
party, and I judged that in his house I would be
safe from observation until the hour came for me
to meet Marie. I was in a frame of mind not easy
to describe. I was conscious that I had played an
utterly despicable part toward my friend, whilst
at the same time I fully believed that I was justified
in rescuing Marie&mdash;so I put it to myself&mdash;from
her unhappy condition, and I had persuaded myself
moreover that any means were justifiable to
attain that end and give me the woman I loved.
That love for her had grown to be part of my
life. How it all came about I know not; but it
was on my return from the campaign in the
Milanese that I met her, frivolous and gay,
amongst the gay and brilliant beauties of the
“Queen-Mother’s Squadron.” She had been but
lately married to the Comte de Marcilly, a family
arrangement, and though there was love on his
side there was none on hers&mdash;as she thought&mdash;and
they slowly drifted apart. It was the case of
a wife, feather-brained, but good at heart, with
just enough imagination to make it a peril, and
of a husband who could neither come down to his
wife’s level nor lift her to his. And the result was
unhappiness. It was at this moment that we
met, and one of those friendships that will spring
up between man and woman sprang up between
us, and inch by inch we drifted nearer to danger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>without either suspecting it. Then came the revelation,
and I learned what she was to me&mdash;and
she&mdash;to this day I know not if she ever loved me&mdash;but
for the moment she was as mad as I was,
and am still, when I think of her. As I walked
on, however, I was sore at heart. My conscience
was still awake within me, though its voice was
unheeded, and I went on, sullen and resolved on
my course, one whom it would have been dangerous
to cross at the moment. I went straight
onward until I came to the river face, and then
turning sharply to the left followed the Vallée de
Misère until I reached the mouth of the Rue des
Lavandières.</p>

<p>The street was almost deserted, and as I slowly
picked my way along the narrow pavement toward
the Bouton d’Or, as my inn was called, I
noticed that the rain had ceased and that the sky
was opening above, showing the eternal blue
beyond and casting a mellow light on the winding
street, and on the gray and mottled façades of the
old houses that towered on either hand.</p>

<p>The Bouton d’Or was situated about the middle
of the street, a little beyond the hôtel of the
Sieur de Richelieu. As I came up to it, I heard the
sounds of a gay chorus from within, and hesitated
a moment, doubtful if, under the circumstances, I
should venture in. It was whilst I stood thus
that I was startled by a voice.</p>

<p>“Alms! Alms! He who giveth unto the poor
lendeth unto the Lord!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>I turned, and saw the lean figure of a Capuchin
at my elbow. His hood, drawn up, almost concealed
his features; but I caught a glimpse of a
face, strangely pale, and of two fiery eyes that
flashed out from beneath the shadow of his cowl.
Though I was of the New Faith, I gave him some
silver, and as he mumbled a benediction the
chorus burst out again from within.</p>

<p>“They are gay,” I muttered to myself; but, low
as my tone was, the words caught the ears of the
friar.</p>

<p>“There is a time to be gay, and a time to be
grave, my son&mdash;and ’tis better to drink than to
conspire.”</p>

<p>And with these words he abruptly turned from
me, and crossing the narrow road, began to descend
the street, beating with his stick on the
pavement, like a blind man feeling his way.</p>

<p>There was something so ominous in the tone of
the man’s voice, so curious in his manner, that
for a moment I had more than a mind to follow
him and make him show his face and explain his
words. But as I made a step forward, he accosted
another passer-by with his strange call for
alms, staying him by placing upon his shoulder
a hand so thin and white that it seemed almost
transparent.</p>

<p>“Bah!” I said to myself, as the new victim
fumbled in his pocket, with an ill grace, to pay his
dole. “’Tis a mad friar, after all!” And without
more ado I entered the inn, to come face to face
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>with the last man I desired to meet at the time.
It was the young Baron de St. Cyergue, the son
of Bohier, the late Receiver General of Normandy,
and though good-hearted, he was a scandal-monger
and a gossip, though amusing enough in his
way, being much given to vaunting his exploits
with the dice-box, in arms, and in love. He
prided himself on being a <i>viveur</i>, and had almost
dissipated a fine inheritance. It was this cackler
that I met, standing in the hall, with a bottle of
wine in each hand, and a face red and flushed.</p>

<p>“Vibrac!” he exclaimed, “welcome! welcome! I
saw you at the Louvre this morning, and meant
to ask you to join our party here, but you were
engaged, and I could not get a chance to put in a
word,” and he leered at me cunningly.</p>

<p>Cursing my ill-fortune at having fallen into the
hands of this bore, I was about to make my
excuses and exit at the same time; but he put a
bottle on the floor and seized me by the lapel of
my cloak.</p>

<p>“Now you are not going to say you have another
engagement! You must come and join us.
There is Lignières, the brightest wit in Paris, and
some one you will be glad to see, no less than
your old friend Ponthieu of the Trans-Alpine Infantry,
who served with you in Milan and the
Sicilies; he is my mother’s cousin, and but arrived
in Paris this morning.”</p>

<p>I would have shaken him off but for the mention
of Ponthieu’s name. He was Gascon of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>good family, an old friend of mine, and one of
the most trusted agents of our party&mdash;a man
whose reckless daring often succeeded where skilful
plans failed, and it would, perhaps, be well
to meet him. I hesitated and was lost, for St.
Cyergue shouted out.</p>

<p>In a moment the door of an adjoining room
opened, and half a dozen men crowded around
me, and I found myself shaking hands with Ponthieu,
who asked twenty questions in a breath,
and five minutes later we were seated round a
table pledging our host’s health. To tell the
truth, now that I had joined the party, I felt
the better for it. It took me out of myself, and
it was a pleasure to meet Ponthieu. We were
able to exchange a word or so, and the Gascon
told me he was leaving Paris that very night.</p>

<p>“If you are caught, it will be Montfauçon!”
I said, and Ponthieu smiled.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon ami!</i> I am leaving Paris in the train of
Catherine herself.” I looked at him hardly, and
was about to express my surprise and add another
warning when St. Cyergue cut in, the wine
passed, and the conversation became general.</p>

<p>Now, in the strangeness of things, what followed
was to affect the whole of my future, and
it is necessary that I should go into some detail.
The room in which we sat opened out into a
small courtyard surrounded by a high wall. A
side door gave access to the street, and near it
grew a stunted apple-tree that somehow lived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>and thrived amidst its sterile surroundings. Beneath
the apple-tree was a rustic seat and a table,
and as we drank and talked I observed the side
door open, and the Capuchin entered and called
for alms. The innkeeper went out, not best pleased
to attend to him, but it was dangerous to cross
a priest then. He motioned the friar to a seat
on the bench and served him&mdash;as sparingly as
possible. As I looked the vague mistrust I had
of that strange figure when we first met came
upon me once more, and I said, as I pointed to
him:</p>

<p>“See there! He might be a spy for all we
know.”</p>

<p>“He is welcome to spy here,” said St. Cyergue,
“we but conspire against red wine.”</p>

<p>“Let us call the friar and make him drink our
health,” said some one.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed Lignières, who had hitherto
kept silent, contenting himself with filling his glass
each time the bottle passed him. “Waste wine
on a friar? Not I! ’Twould be better to drink
to the bright eyes of our mistresses. Would it
not, Vibrac?” I shrugged my shoulders and
laughed; but the man, being a little in his cups,
went at me with the persistence of a fly.</p>

<p>“Yes! we will toast our mistresses, and the last-comer
shall have the place of honor, and toast
her first. Go on, Vibrac, name her&mdash;fill your
glasses, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“We will toast her without naming her,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>Ponthieu, and the others laughed in approval as
St. Cyergue cut in.</p>

<p>“By far the best plan. I, for one, would find
it difficult to name my particular star.”</p>

<p>“You change her every day with your hat and
cloak, eh, baron?” sneered Lignières, who was beginning
to be quarrelsome; “you are not like
our Strephon here, constant only to his Chloe.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte, you go too far,” I
warned him, but he laughed recklessly.</p>

<p>“If you do not name her, I will, and put you
to shame as a chicken-livered lover,” and he rose
to his feet with his glass held out at arm’s
length before him. St. Cyergue tried to stop him,
but it was useless.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” he said, “here’s to Chloe of the
blue eyes and fair hair. Here’s to sweet Ma&mdash;&mdash;!”
He spoke no more, for I had risen in uncontrollable
anger and flung the glass I held in my hand
in his face, and he stood, sober enough now, wiping
his bleeding lips with the back of his hand
and looking at me with death in his eyes. Then,
with a little gasp, for he was almost speechless
with rage, he pointed to the courtyard.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, and with a bow I replied, “I
am at your service, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Not a word more was said, and we passed out
silently into the courtyard. The landlord, seeing
what was about to happen, would have raised
an outcry, but Ponthieu sternly bade him be silent,
and he slunk shivering against the lee of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>the wall. I took off my coat and vest, and as
I flung them on the rustic bench noticed that the
friar was still there&mdash;he was standing calmly staring
at us.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon père!</i>” said St. Cyergue, “you had better
go.”</p>

<p>And the reply came in deep, stern tones:</p>

<p>“There may be work for a priest when this is
done.”</p>

<p>“Let him stay. If he goes, he may call the
watch,” said one of those present, and St.
Cyergue turned on his heel with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Lignières had followed my example, and stripped
to his shirt, then came the few brief preliminaries,
and Ponthieu’s sharp</p>

<p>“<i>Allez, messieurs!</i>”</p>

<p>For a little we tried to feel each other’s strength,
and it was nothing but pretty sword-play. But
it soon came to deadly earnest, for I was in a
white heat with rage, and almost beside myself
with the events of the day; whilst Lignières&mdash;well&mdash;he
meant to kill me as he had killed others
before.</p>

<p>But it was his hour; and it was all over in
five minutes. He thrust too low in quarto, I parried,
and with the riposte ran him through, and
with a gasp he flung his sword into the air, and
fell backward, rolling limply on his side as he
touched the flagstones.</p>

<p>I stood over him, my red sword quivering in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>my hand, and the others crowded round, grave
and pale.</p>

<p>Ponthieu was kneeling by the fallen man, his
hand to his heart, a troubled look on his face.
And now the tall figure of the Capuchin stole
silently up, and bending down, he said to Ponthieu,
“I said there would be work for me.”</p>

<p>Then passing his arm round Lignières’ neck, he
raised his head, and held a crucifix before those
glazing eyes, which opened once, to close again
forever. There was a sigh, a quiver of the limbs,
and a strong man was dead&mdash;slain for a light
word and a foolish jest.</p>

<p>It was then that Ponthieu caught me by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Go!” he said. “We will see to the rest.”</p>

<p>“You bear witness, gentlemen, that he forced
it on me&mdash;that it was in fair fight,” I said
hoarsely, and there was a murmur of assent.</p>

<p>“Go!” repeated Ponthieu, and I walked to the
bench for my hat and coat. As I stooped to get
them, I found the Capuchin by my side. He
helped me with my things, and as he did so whispered
low:</p>

<p>“There is no need to fear: Monsieur did the
Queen-Mother and the State a great service when
he took off his coat for this little affair,” and he
half turned toward the group gathered in the
centre of the courtyard. I barely caught the
words, though they came back to me with their
full force very shortly. At the time, however, all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>that I wanted was to put a distance between
myself and the still figure lying there, that but
a moment before had been so full of life and
strength. I made no answer to the friar, spoke
no word of farewell to the others; but fastening
the clasp of my cloak, and pulling my hat over
my brows, went out, red-handed, into the street.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PARTING OF THE WAYS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> walked</span> rapidly toward the Vallée Misère,
looking neither to the right nor to the left of
me. What had happened had not been my fault.
The quarrel was none of my seeking, and Lignières
would have surely killed me if the luck had been
with him. And yet I shuddered at it all. Though
I had taken life before, it was in the heat of battle,
and the thing had left no impression upon
me. But work of this kind was new to me, and,
despite my four campaigns and a soldier’s life, it
was the first time that a man had died thus at
my hands. I felt it as a presage of ill-fortune to
come, and full of useless regrets and gloomy forebodings,
I moodily paced the foreshore of the river
watching the sunset fade from gold to purple,
and from purple to gray, that lightened again
as the moon rose and hung heavily in the sky,
throwing her soft beams on the shadowy, irregular
lines of the city and gleaming in scales of
silver on the lapping waters of the Seine.</p>

<p>It was whilst I stood thus for a moment that
I once more heard the voice of the Capuchin uttering
his dismal cry:</p>

<p>“Alms! Alms! He who giveth unto the poor,
lendeth unto the Lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>He seemed to be coming my way, and the voice
sounded quite close. I glanced back, but could
see nothing for the quaking mist that rose slowly
from the moist banks. Near me was a small
boat, and, without more ado, I stepped in and
told the boatman to row me down the river. I
did this on the impulse of the moment, for I felt
it was impossible for me to meet the friar again.</p>

<p>I was soon out in mid-stream, far from his presence
and out of earshot of his doleful cry, and the
boatman, resting on his oars, allowed the skiff
to drift slowly down the current. Finally we
floated opposite the façade of the Louvre. It was
ablaze with light, and, from where I was, I could
distinctly see dark shadows flitting hastily to and
fro across the windows, and then the trumpets
of the archers sounded the assemble, the brazen
notes coming harshly to us across the night.</p>

<p>Leaning forward on his oars as we rocked on
the waters, the boatman asked:</p>

<p>“The King goes to-night, does he not, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“So ’tis said,” I answered shortly, and then,
“Take me back to the quay.”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and did as he
was bidden. It was none of his business where
his fares wanted to be taken, as long as they
paid him; and, as we touched the bank, I dropped
a gold Henri into his palm and sprang ashore,
leaving him alternately looking at the coin and
staring after me in blank amazement as I hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
along the quay. I had, however, effected
my object and avoided the Capuchin, and, in my
present frame of mind, that was worth even more
than the gold piece I placed in the boatman’s
hands.</p>

<p>It now wanted but a half-hour to compline,
and with a beating heart I hurried on to keep
my tryst. The shortest way was by the old
church of St. Thomas, and turning sharply to
my right, I followed the narrow street until I
had passed the Magasins. A little beyond was the
riding school, and beyond that again the grove
of lime-trees, in which I had told Badehorn to
keep the horses. I hastened thither, and found
him there.</p>

<p>He had left my house soon after I had, and
could give me no news of what had happened
since. But I afterward learned that shortly
after I had gone, M. de Bresy, with some of the
archer-guard, had arrived to effect my arrest,
and failing in that, had destroyed almost everything
they could lay their hands on. It was the
fortune of war; but on a subsequent occasion I
had my turn with de Bresy, as will be seen hereafter.
Having seen that the horses were safe, I
retraced my steps until I came to the wicket-gate.
Opening it with my key, I stepped in, and
found myself in the outer gardens of the Louvre.
A long avenue of trees stretched before me, the
grass-grown ride between them in checkered light
and shade. To the left rose the walls of the riding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
school, and beyond was the gray line of the
inner wall of the Louvre, and the terraces of the
private gardens of the palace; but there was no
soul to be seen.</p>

<p>“Marie! Marie!” I called out in a low but clear
voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Overhead the leaves
shivered, and from without the hum of the city
came to me, rising and falling with the wind
like the murmur of distant waves on a lone seashore.</p>

<p>Was she going to fail me? Had anything happened
to prevent her coming? I felt my heart
grow cold at the thought, and peering into the
moonlit night listened and listened full of anxious
fears; but I heard no sound of advancing
footsteps, saw nothing but the ivy-grown walls
of the riding school, the wavering trees, and the
phantom outlines of the Louvre looming vast
and gigantic in the night.</p>

<p>All at once from the Queen’s Terrace I heard
the challenge of a sentry, and as it died away
the bells of the Augustins began to sound the
compline, and abbey and church took up the peal
till all Paris rang with the musical chime of
bells.</p>

<p>“She cannot be long now,” I muttered, to assure
myself, and then my straining eyes saw a
gray figure flit across a band of light in the avenue,
and still keeping under cover of the trees I
hastened toward it. Nearer and nearer came the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>figure. It was Marie, and stepping out from the
shadow, I called:</p>

<p>“Marie! It is I&mdash;Vibrac.”</p>

<p>She stopped, hesitated, then came forward
slowly, and taking her hand in mine, I drew her
toward me. For one brief moment she remained
thus, her head resting upon my shoulder, and
strong man as I was, I stood there shivering at
her touch like the leaves of the trees above me.</p>

<p>“At last!” I murmured, “at last!” But my
voice seemed to bring her to herself. With a little
gasp she freed herself from me, and when I would
have restrained her she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Let me go! I cannot talk like this. I want
to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Marie! There is but little time.”</p>

<p>“But time for what I have to say. Oh, Vibrac!
Have you thought of what this will all lead to?”</p>

<p>“To happiness for us.”</p>

<p>“Happiness! Do you think there can be happiness
when there will be nothing but useless regrets
for the past that can never be undone. With
time you will realize all this. You will hate and
despise me.”</p>

<p>“Marie!”</p>

<p>“Yes, hate and despise me for what I am. And
I&mdash;even now I hate&mdash;I despise myself.”</p>

<p>“Marie! What new madness is this? Surely
you do not doubt me? I love you and you only.
Far away from France what shall we care of
babblers who talk? What is the world to us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>who are all in all to each other?” And in my
eagerness I placed my hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, all in all in sin, and we cannot go away
from ourselves. Don’t touch me now. I must
say what I came to tell you. Monsieur, I will
save you from yourself&mdash;I must save myself too!”
And then, with pitiful entreaty in her voice, “Oh,
Vibrac! Give me strength. Help me a little!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do not understand,” I stammered, though
I knew well what she meant.</p>

<p>“You do not understand? You must. Oh, Vibrac!
Do you not see that in a moment of wicked
folly we resolved to take a step from which there
can be no withdrawal. Oh! I do not blame you.
It was my fault to have listened to you, to have
led you on unwittingly&mdash;and you are but a boy
still! But I want you to be a brave man. Banish
me from your thoughts! I am not what you
think&mdash;but, God knows, I am not a bad woman&mdash;and
there is time yet to draw back&mdash;to save
myself and you.”</p>

<p>“You would desert me?” I asked bitterly, a dull
despair in my heart.</p>

<p>“No!” she answered, the low, rich tones of her
voice vibrating through the night. “I would
stand by you and recall you to your strength.
God would desert us if we did this thing.”</p>

<p>“We should have thought of that before&mdash;it is
too late now.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it is not too late&mdash;you must do as I tell
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>But I was not going to let her slip through
my hands. I had paid for her with my honor.
For her sake my hands were red, and Lignières
lay stark and dead. I had earned my reward
and would have it, and, mad at the thought of
losing her, I gripped her by the arm, and&mdash;the
shame of it&mdash;I told her I would slay her and myself,
rather than lose her.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but remained calmly looking
at me as I stood in front of her, the hot blood
throbbing in my head, my breath coming thick
and fast. There, as we faced each other, the moon
passed the shadow of the trees and threw its light
on her, keeping me still in darkness. She was
pale as the dead, but she neither flinched nor
showed the slightest sign of fear, and we remained
thus for a minute&mdash;a minute that might have been
an hour, so slowly did it pass. At last she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Do you think I fear death? Not now, Vibrac!
Not now! If it came it would be a just punishment&mdash;an
expiation,” but even as she spoke I felt
the sting of shame at my unmanly words, words
uttered in the madness of one who was beside
himself, and I loosed my hand from her
arm.</p>

<p>“God forgive me!” I cried, “I did not mean
that.”</p>

<p>“God has much to forgive us both, Vibrac. Oh,
monsieur, we are both on the threshold of a great
sin, and I am a weak woman and you a man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Give me strength! Help me to do what is
right!”</p>

<p>Help her! It was I who needed help, not Marie.</p>

<p>“You never loved me!” I exclaimed in my bitterness.</p>

<p>“I cannot love you in the way you want,” and
then coming closer to me she placed her hand on
my shoulder with a tender, almost caressing
touch, and looked into my eyes. “Listen, monsieur!”
she said. “If it will help you to be yourself
I will tell you of myself. I never knew my
own heart until I left you to-day&mdash;and I left you
after hearing every word that passed between you
and my husband. I thought his love was gone
from me, and it was a desperate, foolish woman
who promised you what she did. I know now
that Marcilly loves me still, and with God’s help
I mean to be a better woman and deserve his
love. On the brink of the precipice I have saved
myself and saved you, and, monsieur, my weakness
has passed now, and I will do what is
right.”</p>

<p>She paused as if waiting for an answer, but I
could say nothing. In my heart I knew she was
right. Yet it was as if all the brightness had
gone out of my life, and I stood there numbed
and speechless.</p>

<p>“Say something, Vibrac!” she exclaimed. “Tell
me you have forgiven an erring woman, who has
caused you all this pain. Say, you will try and
do what I ask, and forget me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>I turned from her, and walked slowly across the
ride, my head held down, my hands clenched in an
agony. All that was good in me rose and clamored
for her pleading. The strength that had
come to her seemed to bring strength to me, and
when I faced her again I was victor over myself.</p>

<p>“Let it be as you wish,” I said hoarsely.
“Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” And our hands met. And then
womanlike she spoke again.</p>

<p>“Monsieur! You must never see me again. But
I will hear of you, and let me hear you are still,
what I have always heard and known you to be&mdash;a
brave and noble gentleman.”</p>

<p>Bowing low I touched her hand with my lips,
and then releasing it, stepped aside and lifted my
hat.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” she said again softly, and turning,
passed swiftly and silently, like a ghost, up the
long avenue. Once she stopped, where the moonlight
shone brightly, and looked back, and then
she was gone.</p>

<p>Near me lay the mouldering trunk of a fallen
tree. I sat down there and stared stupidly before
me. Something of the resolve, something of the
unspoken promise I had made to her, came to me
to give me strength. Yes, I would forget her. I
would carry with me into my new life no memory
of her. I slipped my hand in my breast pocket
for the letters and the glove&mdash;to destroy them.
They were gone, and with them the scroll of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>names. In my horror at the loss I sprang to my
feet, and searched around me; but with no avail;
and then, the parting words of the Capuchin came
to me, and for the first time I grasped their full
meaning. I had indeed done the Queen-Mother
and the tyrants of Guise a service, when I left my
coat by the side of the spy&mdash;for a spy he must
have been&mdash;and he had the letters, and the scroll
with the list of names.</p>

<p>Cursing my folly a hundred times as I reflected
how useless it would be to try and find the man
now, I hurried back to Badehorn, and half an
hour later had left Paris forever.</p>

<p>And so came the parting of the ways. Full of
resolve to conquer the past, I flung myself heart
and soul into the great enterprise that ended in
disaster at Amboise. By strange fortune, I served
again with Marcilly, and strove to efface by my
loyalty and zeal the memory of the wrong I
would have done him. Then I heard that husband
and wife were reconciled, though she still remained
at Orleans with the Court, and the thought that
she had hopelessly passed out of my life maddened
and tortured me beyond endurance. I began
slowly to fall back into my former state. I began
to absolutely hate Marcilly as the man who had
taken away from me my only chance of happiness,
and after that I was ready to yield to
temptation.</p>

<p>Things went against us, as all the world knows.
Then came the news of the arrest and imprisonment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of the Prince of Condé. It came to us at
Châtillon, whither the Princess of Condé had
sought refuge with a few devoted adherents,
amongst whom was Jean de Marcilly; and there,
too, befell that which led me, step by step, along
the Traitor’s Way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT MAJOLAIS SAW</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was Majolais, the black dwarf, who first
pointed it out. We, that is, Lanoy, the Comte
de Marcilly, who was known as “The Shadow of
Condé,” myself, and lastly Majolais, who had no
business to be there, were on the platform of the
stone cavalier, built up against the keep of Châtillon,
where the walls fell sheer into the Indre.</p>

<p>A little to our right was a projecting oriel window,
in the bay of which sat the Princess,
Condé’s wife, with avid eyes that looked ever to
the north. It was partly to escape those eyes,
which implored and upbraided at once, whenever
they fell on us, that we had come out, and were
pacing backward and forward, trying to talk,
with hearts as heavy as lead. But we had to flog
ourselves for this, the effort to speak was so
painful, and at last there was a dead silence, and
we tramped up and down, in a sullen and speechless
way.</p>

<p>Finally Lanoy and the Comte, separating from
me, leaned over the battlements, and looked down
into the town below, at the pointed gables, the
red and gray roofs, and the narrow, winding
streets, where the people were as ants moving
restlessly to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>And I, I was left to my thoughts, such thoughts
as a man has who has sinned and regretted, and
then sinned again. They sting like an adder now
when I recall them, and they hurt even then; but
I shook them from me as a dog shakes the water
from his coat, and, standing still, looked aimlessly
around.</p>

<p>It was winter, but the sun was out, and the air
crisp. I glanced up at the spread of the sky, half
filled with a mountainous pile of soft white clouds
glistening in the light, and wondered to myself
that the sun could shine on such a hell as lay beneath
it. The sky was as blue, the clouds as silver
white in the north, as in the south, the east,
the west. And yet the heavens should have been
black there, above Amboise and the Orléanais,
black as a pall, and lit only by the pitying eyes
of the stars, for there the Italian woman and the
Lorrainers were shedding the best blood of France
like water.</p>

<p>Let me stop for a moment to explain in a few
words why we were as we were. The King&mdash;he
was barely sixteen, and already dying of a terrible
disease&mdash;together with Mary of Scotland, his
young Queen, were in the hands of the brothers of
Guise and Catherine, and Lorrainer and Italian
were both, for the present, partners. The country
was bankrupt. In the King’s name they reduced
it to beggary. The people were starving. They
let them die. They seem to have gone blood mad
in their thirst for power. It was nothing but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>“Kill! kill!” Add to this a religious persecution
of the most intolerable kind, and the picture of the
times is roughly outlined.</p>

<p>The most fiendish cruelties were inflicted in the
name of the Law, and of God, against the followers
of the New Faith, or rather of the Old
Faith that was found anew. “Huguenots!” they
called us in derision, after the wretched farthing
piece, or, as some say, after the goblin King of
Tours&mdash;I neither know nor care which&mdash;the name
was yet to be one of terror to the Woman of
Babylon.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the old nobility, and Princes of the
blood, found themselves prisoners, or practically
exiles. Their hereditary rights were denied to
them, they were cut off from the State. It is not
strange that all the liberalism, all the patriotism
in France, saw with horror the coming ruin of
their country, and forgetting, for the moment,
differences of creed, coalesced with one accord
against the tyrants. The outcome of this was the
attempt of Amboise&mdash;and its results are known.</p>

<p>The Right had lost, by the will of God, and
now the conquerors were slaking their vengeance
in blood, and in the name of the child King condemning
their victims to hideous tortures and to
awful deaths. In the history of my country there
is but one crime darker than this, one page more
stained with sin. But the day was yet far distant
when the bells of St. Germain l’Auxerrois
were to clang out the signal for the Feast of St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>Bartholomew, and we, who stood gasping with
horror, thought that the worst had befallen
France.</p>

<p>The one hope of all Frenchmen who loved their
country, Louis of Condé, was in the hands of the
Guisards. His life hung by a hair, and on that
life hung, as we thought then, the safety of
France. We were powerless to help, and here at
Châtillon we, who had escaped disaster as yet,
were practically prisoners, for de Termes held us
in check from Ligueil, and the lances of Montluc
gleamed from every tower from Buzançais to St.
Aignan. We were, in short, caged. We could run
about in our cage but not beyond its bars. We
were in a trap&mdash;like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>The Princess of Condé, Eleanore de Roye, had
sunk into a speechless grief that was terrible to
witness. Every day brought danger nearer and
nearer, and yet she refused to move, refused to
make any attempt at escape; we might have
twice made a dash for Poitou, where the Admiral
and the Rhinegrave were still in some force. She,
however, declined point blank, and sat like a
Penelope, weaving endless plans to free her husband,
each one more hopeless than the other.</p>

<p>I stood, as I have said, on the cavalier, looking
aimlessly at the sky, and then made a half movement
to join my friends, when I was arrested by
a cry, such a cry as might come from the throat
of a tongueless man, and, turning round, saw
Majolais on the carriage of a brass carronade,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>pointing eagerly at something. The wind had
caught his short red cloak, blowing it out like a
banner, and the hooded falcon he held in leash
was screaming and fluttering overhead, the full
length of his tether. There the creature stood,
distorted and misshapen, uttering his strange
cries, now looking at me, then turning his yellow
eyes down the St. Aignan road, and swinging his
arms wildly.</p>

<p>I hastened toward him, Lanoy and Marcilly
after me, and we three tried to follow the Moor’s
glance, but could make out nothing, although
Majolais, in his eagerness to show us what he
saw, now plucked at our sleeves, now leaned half
out of the embrasure, his arm stretched out toward
the plain beneath him, the falcon screaming
overhead, and he gibbering the whole time like
the wild thing he was.</p>

<p>At last I saw it&mdash;I, the youngest of the three.
Running my eyes along the white, glistening road
I made out a small speck. Seizing the dwarf’s
hand I held it out in that direction and, nodding
assent, he fairly danced with joy.</p>

<p>“There!” I cried, “that little speck beyond the
wood there! ’Tis that the imp means.”</p>

<p>Then they saw too, and shading his eyes with
his hands Lanoy looked hard and earnestly.</p>

<p>“Some one rides there for his life,” he said. “I
would we had the tube Cortoni made for the
King. We would see him then as close as my
hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he comes from Orleans. He may be
for us,” I hazarded.</p>

<p>They did not answer, but we craned our necks
and strained our eyes, whilst the spot flew faster
and faster, and grew bigger and bigger, until at
last we all saw clearly that it was a man on
horseback, and that he was heading straight for
Châtillon, for he passed the cross-road to Tours.</p>

<p>The Princess and her ladies, observing the
dwarf’s gestures and our movements, came out to
join us, and we all watched in an excited but
silent group. It was not a wonderful thing, this
sight of a man riding at full speed; but somehow
we all felt, though we did not say so, that he
was riding for us.</p>

<p>She, the Princess of Condé, stood with her hands
on the brass gun, leaning slightly forward, her
lips parted, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes straining.
It was as if she was striving to read on the
rider’s face the message he bore.</p>

<p>On a sudden Mademoiselle de Mailly, who was
next to her, called out:</p>

<p>“See! He wears a white scarf! Look, madame!
Look!”</p>

<p>True enough. Across his left shoulder, and
streaming a yard behind him, was a white scarf,
the emblem of our party.</p>

<p>“He is for us,” the girl called out shrilly; “he
must be from Orleans, madame. Ah, madame!”
and she turned half round with clasped hands;
but the Princess made no answer, staring straight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>at the coming man with hot eyes, eyes that
burned with eagerness, eyes that blazed with a
hundred questions at once.</p>

<p>“The fool!” muttered Lanoy. “The idiot! To
wear that scarf now! If any of Montluc’s
troopers are skulking in that wood he is
lost.”</p>

<p>Jean de Marcilly touched me softly on the
shoulder, and our glances met. I knew what he
meant, and answered with the positive assurance
of youth.</p>

<p>“It is needless. He is perfectly safe, and we will
have only our labor for our pains. I rode
through the wood but two hours ago. There
was no one there, and Coqueville tells me Montluc’s
bees are hiving elsewhere to-day.”</p>

<p>“That is my latest news. It would almost
seem that we have yet another chance to go if
we wanted,” said a quiet voice, and the Captain
of Châtillon joined us.</p>

<p>It was as if Lanoy was about to speak, when
Marcilly cut in impatiently.</p>

<p>“Bees or no bees, I go!” And he looked at me
again. I made a step forward, and then, in a
flash, there came a strange and wicked whisper to
my soul.</p>

<p>“Let him go. He may die&mdash;may get killed, and
you and she will be free.”</p>

<p>It was almost as if a living voice hissed this
into my ear, and I clung to the thought. I
would not meet Marcilly’s eyes, though I watched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>him beneath my glance, and with a laugh and a
lifting of his brows he was gone.</p>

<p>“Take Badehorn and Schoner, the German
reiter, with you,” called Coqueville after him, and
we heard him halloo back as he sped down the
winding stair. I was glad of this. It removed
attention from me. Although I was aware that
no one had noticed us, I felt as if all eyes were on
me when Marcilly spoke. I found myself near
Majolais, and the dwarf winked at me as if he
knew. I turned with a muttered curse, and
sought refuge next to Yvonne de Mailly. I do
not know how it was, but in her eagerness perhaps
to see, she leaned forward, and her hand
rested lightly on my arm. I caught the dwarf’s
glance again, and he laughed to himself. I could
have flung him from the battlements.</p>

<p>In a moment more we saw Marcilly crossing the
bridge. Neither Badehorn nor Schoner were with
him. He was alone, and I waited and watched.</p>

<p>Now the wood mentioned above was a part of
the forest of Châtillon that stretched eastward,
extending an arm, as it were, to the St. Aignan
road, a bit of which it hid from our view. As
Marcilly crossed the bridge the stranger passed
behind the trees, and then we heard the distant
crack of an arquebus, and a suppressed cry burst
from the Princess.</p>

<span class="smaller">POUR MA FOY, ET MON ROY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“H</span>e</span> is lost! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she exclaimed.
“Ah! Monsieur de Vibrac!” And she just
looked at me; but such a look.</p>

<p>There was a clattering of spurred heels as
Coqueville and Lanoy rushed to the stairway;
but, trembling and hot with shame, I remained
chained by the horrible thought that had taken
possession of me. I knew what the Princess
meant. I had said that the wood was safe, and
yet I had not searched there in that long, narrow
neck of forest before us, and our man was lost.
Yet no! He was out again; but this time not
alone, for three men were at his heels, three men
with fresh horses. One came alongside. Our man
leaned out sideways with extended arm&mdash;a glint
of steel&mdash;and it was a riderless horse that galloped
by his side, with long, loose, trailing reins; and
then it fell, and, scrambling up, stood stupidly by
the side of the road.</p>

<p>Yvonne de Mailly’s white fingers tightened over
my arm, and I saw her pale a little as she gave
a quick gasp. The dwarf almost screamed, and I
thought I heard the echo of a prayer from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>Princess. I watched with dry, parched lips, and
hell in my heart.</p>

<p>It was still two to one, and these were heavy
odds; but Marcilly was not far, and going like
the wind. The two pursuers hung closely behind
the fugitive&mdash;there was a long, dark thing in the
snow, athwart the road, where the third lay, still
and motionless. But the two, intent and eager,
took no note of Jean, saw nothing of Lanoy and
Coqueville and the half-dozen others who spurred
behind them. Our man did, however; he bent forward
in his saddle, and his good horse seemed to
fly.</p>

<p>We watched in a breathless silence. And then&mdash;it
had come and gone in a moment. The fugitive
was safe. He had passed Marcilly and was close
to the others. But Jean&mdash;my breath came thick
and fast. Was it to be, after all? The leading
horse against Marcilly swerved to one side. Its
rider, seeing the succor at hand, turned off to his
left and made for the wood; and Lanoy&mdash;there
was no mistaking the bay horse, and tall, thin
figure&mdash;cut across country to intercept him. I
saw no more of that. All my eyes were for
Marcilly and his adversary.</p>

<p>There was no better sword than Jean in France.
I could have sworn that, until now. But what
was this? There was a circle of light as they
came together, something flashed downward,
and Marcilly was disarmed. And then&mdash;it was all
in a hand-turn, remember&mdash;a strange thing happened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Marcilly’s adversary raised his sword to
the salute and, leaving him harmless, rode
straight on toward Coqueville and his men. He
broke right through them, and, pulling across the
road, galloped off at a break-neck pace toward
Tours. There was no attempt to follow. They
all gathered in a group round some one who had
fallen. Once the man faced half round, and shook
his clenched fist behind him, and then there was
the light of his red plume, and we lost him to
view in the thickets and low forest that fringed
the river&mdash;and he escaped.</p>

<p>But our man was safe, no thanks to me. He
reined up at the bridge, crossing it slowly, and
then we saw him rock in his saddle.</p>

<p>“He is hurt!” exclaimed the Princess: but I
heard no more. I was down the long stairway
three steps at a time, and, hurrying across the
flagged court, was just able to meet the stranger,
for, as I reached the castle gates, he entered, his
horse stopping under the stone archway of its
own accord, with head held down and heaving
flanks, while the rider hung low over the saddle.
Seeing me approach, however, he steadied himself
with an effort, answering my “Well ridden and
bravely done, monsieur,” with a white smile and
a hoarse, “’Twas between the skin and the flesh.”
As he spoke I thought he would have fallen, and
rushed to his side.</p>

<p>“Back!” I shouted to those who crowded round.
“Back! Give room!” and, helping him to dismount,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and lending him my arm, for he was very
faint, and kept up only by his courage, we crossed
the yard slowly, and began to ascend the stone
steps of the main entrance, where I already saw
the Princess with a group round her. As we
reached the steps, she called out in sudden recognition:</p>

<p>“It is Maligny! Maligny!” And she ran down
to us. “Speak, man! Speak! My husband&mdash;Condé&mdash;what
of him?”</p>

<p>He bit his dry lips and looked around, then
answered thickly:</p>

<p>“The King has agreed to his death; but there is
still hope. I bring his message to you. It is:
<i>Take the young child and flee into Egypt</i>. And,
madame&mdash;go now&mdash;for it will be too late to-morrow.”
He said the last words quickly, as if
he felt he would not have time to finish his speech,
and then fell sideways into my arms like a dead
man.</p>

<p>And now I saw what a good woman can do.
Save for a rapid gesture of despair as Maligny
gave his abrupt message, she made no sign, but
bent over the fainting man, giving some orders
about him as calmly as if he, and he alone, were
the one object that filled her mind. We carried
him to the nearest room&mdash;mine&mdash;and Chandieu,
the Prince’s chaplain, a man skilled in wounds,
was soon by his side. To our intense relief, he
pronounced Maligny merely faint from fatigue,
saying that the wound on his arm was nothing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>and that he would be as well as ever in a few
hours. Then he took charge of him, driving us
all from the room as he would be alone with his
patient.</p>

<p>We gathered in a group on the rush-covered daïs
of the great hall. We were all there except Marcilly,
whom I saw nowhere. Lanoy had accounted
for his man, and Coqueville was limping
and bruised. It was he who had been ridden
down, and it was thought killed, by the one who
had escaped, but he had come to no hurt.</p>

<p>We were discussing Maligny’s tidings and
Condé’s message, and Coqueville was earnest in
his entreaty for the Princess to leave Châtillon at
once.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “it is not for ourselves I
speak. There is monseigneur here to think of, the
heir of the <i>Sires des fleurs des lys</i>.” As he spoke
he placed his sunburnt hand lightly on the shoulder
of the slender, fair-haired boy, her son, who
stood by her side. He was not alone in pressing
the matter, and it was for an hour or more, perhaps,
that we discussed it, until we reached the
last corner in madame’s patience, for she spoke
firmly and crisply:</p>

<p>“Messieurs! Very well! I shall leave Châtillon
now; but for Orleans. My place is there. I have
neglected my duty too long.”</p>

<p>She was facing us, a small, slight woman she
was, but for the moment she seemed to have
grown absolutely tall. “As for Henri here,” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>went on, stooping and giving the boy a fierce
little kiss, “he must live for vengeance if need
be.”</p>

<p>What more she would have said I know not,
but now Maligny appeared, his arm bandaged,
and leaning for support on Jean. Behind came
Chandieu, a tall, dark figure. As they approached
it was impossible not to be struck by Marcilly’s
resemblance to Condé. In a crowd a hundred
men would have sworn he was the Prince. He
had the same slight, spare figure, the same red-brown
hair, the same eyes, even his voice, his very
gestures were the same.</p>

<p>In the moment of excitement I had forgotten
about myself, else I had not dared to face Marcilly
with the consciousness of my recent shameful
action upon me. It is one crowning mercy that
there are moments when even the most sinful forget&mdash;even
I do sometimes&mdash;for a very little.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Maligny, “I have come to
finish what I fear I began too bluntly. It is true
that the sentence has been passed, but the Chancellor
has refused to affix the Great Seal, and no
day has been appointed for&mdash;&mdash;” and he hesitated
a moment, and then went on, not finishing his
sentence, though we all understood: “The King
is very ill, and at any time may relent. Strange
as it may seem, the Italian is veering round in
our favor. The Guise grow too great, and she
realizes now what that greatness will mean for
her. The Admiral knows her mind, and ’tis said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>that the Constable will now move from Yvoy le
Marron. There is a plan even now to save the
Prince”; he looked at Marcilly, and then went on:
“but, in the mean time, it is of the first importance
that you and the young Prince should be safe
from harm. Monseigneur kisses your hands, and
begs you to leave Châtillon for St. Bauld, where
d’Andelot lies with fifty horse to escort you to the
Admiral and safety. There is one, too, who aids
us in secret&mdash;I dare not give the name&mdash;and I tell
you that no sword will be drawn to stay us if
we leave within the next few hours. Who those
wasps were who attacked me in the wood, I
know not. They are done with, however, for the
present. The danger now is in staying&mdash;none in
going&mdash;but we must go now.”</p>

<p>The Princess hardly seemed to hear the latter
portion of Maligny’s speech. “And so the King&mdash;that
boy&mdash;has signed the warrant!” she said.
“But Lorraine held the pen. But they dare not!
They dare not! After Navarre he is the first
Prince of the blood. And is that all you have to
say? Oh! Take me to him!” And she looked
imploringly at us.</p>

<p>“Madame,” began Maligny, but she broke in
upon his speech.</p>

<p>“Wait! Let me think! I know you have nothing
more to say except to urge me to desert my
husband. I know you are going to repeat that.
Your plans and politics will break my woman’s
heart. Ah! I know he will die. Have ever the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>merciless shown mercy? He will die, I say; but I
die with him. Now hear me, Monsieur le Vicomte&mdash;and
all of you. I go to Orleans&mdash;Orleans&mdash;do
you hear? And I leave in an hour’s time.”</p>

<p>She finished; her hands clenched, her cheeks
white; but in the gray deep of her eyes such a
mixture of rage, sorrow, irresolution, and despair
as I hope never to see in a human glance again.
The strain had been too much, and, highly as she
spoke, I knew and felt that she would yet yield.
It was the old story. It is not in a woman’s
words, but in her eyes, that her heart lies.</p>

<p>As she stood there, silent and motionless, Marcilly
leaned over the Vicomte’s shoulder, and whispered
something. Then they both beckoned to
Lanoy and Chandieu, and retired into the recess
of the window, where they spoke in whispers,
and, as I looked, I saw a smile on Lanoy’s dark
face, a light in the Vicomte’s eyes&mdash;and a jealous
anger came into my heart that I was not asked
to share their confidences.</p>

<p>But here on the daïs, where through the open
window the mellow sunlight fell on the rushes at
our feet, and lit them up in gold and brown;
where still we were partly in shadow, and partly
in light, there was no word spoken, and the
Princess stood, biting her lip and watching the
four. So still was it one might have heard
the fall of a silken glove.</p>

<p>Suddenly the falcon on Majolais’ wrist began to
flutter its wings, and the sound, as it broke the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>stillness, brought the Princess to the moment.
She turned to Coqueville and myself.</p>

<p>“Messieurs! You will excuse me&mdash;time presses.”
With a slight bow to us, and a shrug of her
shoulders in the direction of the four, she walked
slowly down the hall, Yvonne de Mailly turning
as she followed her, and throwing up the palms
of her hands as if to say it was all over.</p>

<p>As the Princess passed the window, however,
Lanoy and the Vicomte came up to her and spoke
in low, rapid tones, Jean standing a little on one
side playing with the hilt of his sword. What
they said I could not catch, but they urged it
again and again, and she put her hands to her
face, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“No! No! I cannot&mdash;I cannot!”</p>

<p>Then Jean stepped forward, dropping on one
knee before her, added his entreaty to those of the
other two, and one by one we came up and
formed a half-circle around them.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Lanoy, “it is not for the
Prince alone. It is for the King, for France. I
pledge you my word he succeeds.”</p>

<p>“What can I say?” she asked. “Friends!” and
she turned toward us, “do you know what I have
been asked to do? I have been asked to accept
the sacrifice of a life. Jean&mdash;our own true knight&mdash;has
said that he will go to Orleans and bring
off the Prince or die.”</p>

<p>“He will succeed, madame,” said Maligny.
“Would to God I could be by his side!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Though our persecutors be swifter than the
eagles of Heaven, yet the Lord of Hosts is with
us. Let him go, madame, that thy beloved may
be delivered. Save with thy right hand and hear
me,” and Chandieu spoke in the words of the
Psalmist, his voice deep but low.</p>

<p>But still the Princess stood&mdash;hesitating&mdash;wavering.
Her pale lips moved as if in prayer, and
then, as one who takes a sudden plunge, she held
out her hands with a quick, impulsive gesture,
and, raising Jean to his feet, looked him full in the
face with eyes that swam with tears.</p>

<p>“May God bless you!” she said; “be it as you
will.”</p>

<p>So they stood for a moment, her hands resting
on his shoulders. Then bending forward she
kissed him, and with a sob turned and passed
out of the room, all following except myself.</p>

<p>It is odd how sometimes, when the mind is distracted,
a petty thing will arrest the attention,
and remain in the memory for ever, a centre upon
which other recollections revolve. As they went
out the last to go was Majolais. At the door he
stopped, a little spot of brilliant color, and,
turning his head, looked back upon me. In that
one moment his eyes seemed to read my thoughts
and mock my misery. So he stood for a breath,
then, pointing a claw-like finger at me, he turned
and fled. It was as if some fiend gibed at my
fall. I remained for long where I was, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>shadow of the heavy curtains that drooped over
the window, glowering at the band of sunlight on
the rushes and thinking of a hundred things.
The past year of my life came before me in vivid
detail. All my struggles with myself, all my
failures. How inch by inch I had slipped down
mentally, until it came to pass that I yielded
without effort to the hideous whisper of the fiend,
when I let Marcilly ride off by himself.</p>

<p>I was certain that Marie loved me still, and that
in her heart she would welcome freedom. But an
hour or so back it was this that made me long,
yet fear, to see him stretched dead in the snow.
It was this that made me hate myself, and yet
urged me on. Fifty times during the scene with
the Princess, had I been within an ace of stepping
to Marcilly’s side, and asking to share his enterprise.
Each time I was held back, caught
by the throat and held back by my evil
thoughts.</p>

<p>To my mind the attempt was impossible. He
must die&mdash;and then&mdash;I became aware I was not
alone, for Jean stood at my right hand smiling
at me with his kind eyes.</p>

<p>“Gaspard,” he said, “I want a friend. You refused
me once to-day. Will you deny me now?
Will you come?”</p>

<p>I was not altogether lost. I was sick with the
shame of what had passed. I dared not refuse.</p>

<p>“I will come,” I answered, and my voice was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>strange, even to my own ears. It was Fate.
Who can resist its decrees?</p>

<p>“<i>Pour ma foy, et mon roy</i>,” he said, linking his
arm in mine, as he quoted the motto of his house.
“To horse, man! There is not a moment to
lose.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A PRIEST OF BAAL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“S</span>o</span> you think your plans well laid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and well thought out, Gaspard.
The idea has been working in my head for some
little time, and what happened to-day has convinced
me it is feasible.”</p>

<p>“I do not follow.”</p>

<p>“I will explain. I owed my life to-day to my
likeness to the Prince. When I was at that man’s
mercy you saw him throw up his sword and pass
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. I remember. Who was he?”</p>

<p>“I know not, but he wore the sash of the
King’s Carabiniers, and he knew Condé, and mistook
me for him. It was astonishing to see the
change in his face. ‘The Prince! <i>Mille démons!</i>’
he exclaimed, and went by me like a flash. Now
it is this lucky resemblance which I mean to use
to effect Condé’s release. But it is necessary to
play a bold game, and we will go straight to
Catherine and offer our swords to the King.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes! And if Madame does not need us, we
find ourselves laid by the heels, and have a fair
chance of our heads shrivelling on the spikes of
The Gate of Good Men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“My friend! There are wheels within wheels
here. Catherine is in sore straits now, and will
extend the amnesty to us, I assure you. Even
you, Huguenot though you are, can count on her
protection if you be for her, as you will be, for
the present. When it suits her purpose, she is as
much Calvinist as you other heretics. What bee
got into your head and made you change your
faith I know not. Was it not enough for you
to live and die as your forefathers?”</p>

<p>“Let that sleep, Marcilly. A man’s conscience is
his conscience. It lies between him and his God.”</p>

<p>“But if his conscience leads him to heresy it
leads him to the stake. However, I say no more,
Gaspard. Heretic or true believer, we have shed
blood for each other, and we will die, if need be,
to keep the foreigner out of France. Let me continue.
You know that Marie is with the Medicis.
In one sense a prisoner, in the other as free as
air. Strange as it may seem, Catherine loves her,
despite her rebel husband, as she calls me.”</p>

<p>“In other words, madame is a hostage.”</p>

<p>“But Catherine has never used her power. A
threat of harm to Marie would have paralyzed me
at once. But, instead of threats, offers of protection
have come for me and my friends.”</p>

<p>“Punic Faith! The Prince trusted the Florentine.
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“But that faith will be kept to us&mdash;to all who
aid her now. She now sees her danger, and the
road open to the Guise if Condé were to die. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>would make another Amboise of the Lorrainers if
she could.”</p>

<p>“You count, then, on the help of that tigress!
Yon deceive yourself.”</p>

<p>“No! I do not count on active help, but passive
help. Consider for a moment! Madame plays to
keep the waning power of the Valois. She knows
well enough that if either the Huguenots&mdash;forgive
the word&mdash;or the Guise destroy each other, they
will eat up the Valois. The Huguenots, with
Condé, made head. She used the Guise to crush
them, but events have proved too much for her,
and the dragon’s teeth she sowed have sprung up
against her in full crop. She lends a willing ear
to the Chancellor, who has declined to affix the
Seal to the warrant. Sancerre has flatly refused
to give his assent to the verdict, and Cipierre, the
Governor of Orleans, who, as you know, is my
uncle, is a deadly foe of the Guise. Fear not!
We will keep our heads and succeed.”</p>

<p>“And the Guise? You have left out that weight
in the scale.”</p>

<p>“Well! We shall see which weighs heavier,
Italian craft or the sword of Lorraine. But, to go
on, the Prince is permitted to see a few friends.
The plan is that I will obtain an interview with
him, and when I, or rather the Prince comes out,
it win be your business to get him to Poitou, and
it is for this that I wanted a true friend, Gaspard,
and who more true than you! Think you
I have forgotten Renty or the Escaillon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>I could hardly bear his praise; the words seemed
to sting like a lash; but I brought myself together
and asked: “And you, Marcilly? Do you know
what this means for you?”</p>

<p>“I,” he laughed, “I will join you in Poitou
later on. But we waste time in chattering. Let
us hasten!”</p>

<p>He knew as well as I did that he never would
see Poitou, and that he was laying down his life
for another as cheerfully as if he were going to a
minuet. And I rode in bitterness by the side of
this man who could be so great while I was so
small. Shame, black shame, filled my heart, for I
was bridle to bridle with one whom I called
friend with my lips, but to whom in my soul I
was a traitor. I felt that I hated him&mdash;hated him
who had done me no wrong all the more because
I sought to injure him. I linked him unreasonably
with the moral degradation into which I had
fallen; and the more I recognized the depth to
which I had sunk, the hotter grew the fires of my
anger. Why did he not die before Châtillon?
There would have been nothing then to stand between
Marie and myself. Yet with this thought
there flashed upon me her own appeal on the
night when last we met. She had given me
strength then, and I resisted. There came a glow
with the memory of that one good deed, a glow
of generous impulse that made me feel for a moment
again a man. I bent my head to the saddle
and prayed for help, a voiceless prayer. Alas! It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>never got beyond the gray darkness of that
night.</p>

<p>To my mind there is no condition more awful
than that of the man who is dragged, as it were,
to the commission of a crime by an irresistible
power, a terrible unseen force that laps round
him like a hungry tide, that drives him onward
through mist and fog, despite his struggles, and
leaves him at last on the shores of the lost, there
to await the last call, there to rot amidst the
maddening phantoms of the past, there to repent,
if there be aught of advantage in repentance.
I have fought with the fiend, struggled
at the foot of the cross, prayed, with tears, for
strength that danced before me to vanish like the
elf-light on a marsh, and then&mdash;came back to my
sin like a hog to his wallow.</p>

<p>And so it was with me now. At the very moment
when I thought I was gaining strength,
when I had gone to God with my heart, I fell
again. We had come to the Loup Garou, that
little stream which, rising in the forest of Villedomain,
steals slowly toward the Indre, as
treacherous in its crafty strength as the beast
from which it takes its name. As we approached
the streamlet the sky darkened, the wind rose,
the birch-trees shook and crackled their dry arms,
and the snow began to fall in soft white flakes.
It was then, in crossing the lonely forest bridge,
that ran on wooden piles from bank to bank,
that the evil came to me, like a shadow of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>approaching night. Marcilly was in front. One
shot from my pistol, and Marie and I were free.
She would never know&mdash;the trees around us were
blind and dumb. They would tell no story, and
I would lock the secret in my heart. My hand
stole toward my holster-flap, and, with a shiver
and a start, I drew it back&mdash;I had forgotten. It
was not only God’s eye that saw me. Scarce a
hundred paces behind rode Badehorn, and I feared
him more than my God. The chance saved me&mdash;simple
chance, or I had fallen utterly. And yet
but a half-hour back I had prayed for help, I
had asked the Most High to give His creature a
little strength&mdash;and here I was but a hand’s
breadth from a mortal sin. There are those who
will tell me that I was guilty of that crime&mdash;that
I am guilty now&mdash;for I had sinned in my soul if
not in deed.</p>

<p>Away in the deep of the forest a dog-wolf
howled, a single, long-drawn note of baffled vengeance,
of quivering, savage despair. The cry
echoed dismally through the birch woods, and
was caught up again among the oaks and
beeches of Loches, until at last it died away,
leaving us to the silence of the softly falling snow.
It was a fit echo to the horror in my soul.</p>

<p>“It blows chill,” exclaimed Marcilly, drawing
his cloak closer around him; “’twill be a bad
night for the Princess’s journey.”</p>

<p>“They may halt at Varennes.” I wondered I
could speak so calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“If Lanoy allows that he is&mdash;but he never will.
They must push through somehow to St. Bauld.”</p>

<p>“And if they do not?” I was speaking at random;
my mind was full of other things.</p>

<p>“Then we are more than half ruined, and the
Guise will hold both the hind and the stag; but,
upon my soul, Gaspard, you must be in love,
you look so sorrowful. Is it Yvonne de Mailly?
She has beauty and birth; but Favras is poor&mdash;nothing
but that old clock-case, his tower in the
Anjoumois. Still, your lands of Vibrac are broad.
Hark! What is that?”</p>

<p>As he spoke there was the distant rumbling of
thunder, and a chain of light blazed overhead.
We all knew what this meant, even the horses.
They snorted and trembled, and then their courage
came back to them like the brave beasts they
were, as we went at a hand gallop through the
snow.</p>

<p>We had now come to the forest of Loches, that
deep, dark wood which makes a fitting setting
to the gloomy stronghold of Louis XI. The darkness
gained upon us rapidly, and soon it became
more and more difficult to follow the road. Now
and then, through the gaps in the trees, through
dead arms of beech or oak, we could catch the
beacon fire on the tower of Beaulieu, and guided
ourselves by its glimmer. We had meant to reach
Chenonceaux by the morning. Under ordinary
circumstances, and with fresh horses such as we
had, this would have been well possible; but now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>in the driving mist and in the darkness, we would
be lucky if we reached the Indrois with the day,
and every moment was of import.</p>

<p>We floundered along at our best pace, which
soon became little more than a shamble, for here,
in the dark arcades of the forest, the horses sank
above their fetlocks in the soft snow, and ever
and again we found ourselves in some shallow
ravine or slimy, ice-covered pool. We could barely
see ten yards ahead, and must have come to a
standstill, but for the incessant lightning that
flashed through the gray gloom, and lit the endless
colonnades of black trees, stretching as far
as the eye could reach on every hand. The wind,
high and strong, hissed through the damp leaves,
bringing down the melting snow, that clung to
them in great drops, and making the boughs
overhead creak and groan like the cordage of a
ship. Now the blast would die away in low
moanings, then it would circle round, and roar
through the forest, and sometimes, amidst the
din of the elements, we could hear the sullen,
plunging crack of some great bough, or perhaps
tree itself, as, worm-riddled and old, it fell heavily
to earth.</p>

<p>We tried to head for what we thought to be
the north, keeping the fire of Beaulieu to our left;
but now this was no longer visible, and so dark
had it become that further progress was all but
impossible. It would have been madness, it
would have meant death, to halt in the storm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>and so we stumbled on as if blind, going we did
not know where. And with the issue we had at
stake! It was as if the very elements themselves
warred against us.</p>

<p>At last we came to what seemed like a steep
ascent. Up this we let the horses scramble, until
we reached a small table-land bereft of trees, and
from the height peered into the darkness around.</p>

<p>“Messieurs!” It was Badehorn who spoke, or
rather shouted. “Messieurs! We are all wrong.
There is the light of Beaulieu to our right! It
should be to our left!”</p>

<p>“Light! There is no light there!” I said,
“though we may well be all wrong, as you say;”
but even as I spoke, something flared and sputtered
redly out of the night.</p>

<p>“That is not Beaulieu; the light is too low,”
said Marcilly, “but Beaulieu or not, let us make
for it, in God’s name! ’Tis useless wandering
here like evil spirits!”</p>

<p>We hastened toward the light, the position of
which we marked as it flashed once more through
the darkness. I said hastened&mdash;I should have said
stumbled toward it. It was necessary, so steep
was the slope, to dismount here, and lead the
horses, which we did, going down in single file,
Marcilly and I groping before us with the points
of our drawn swords.</p>

<p>Finally we reached level ground, and headed
towards our refuge. It was close at hand, and
the horses seemed to know, too, for they neighed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>shrilly, and there was an answering call&mdash;the
strange, harsh cry of a mule.</p>

<p>In a few steps more we came to a gate that
lay open, and saw the house again clearly by a
blaze of lightning. It seemed a large, low, rambling
building, with a tower at one end, from
which the beacon flared, and Marcilly, who knew
every inch of the country, recognized it.</p>

<p>“’Tis the old Château Juvigny, now the abbey
farm of Larçon,” he exclaimed, “the largest farmhouse
in Touraine. I knew it well. ’Twas here
I lay the day before Renaudie died, and but escaped
by the skin of my teeth. Gilles de Randan
and his Light Horse swooped on the place while
my bed was yet warm. I wonder a rafter was
spared!”</p>

<p>“It was well left for our sakes,” I made answer,
and battered at the door with the hilt of
my sword.</p>

<p>We had to knock long and loudly ere we were
heard. A dog barked furiously from within, and
at last a shutter opened overhead, a man leaned
out, swinging a pine torch in his hand, and called
out to us; but the storm bore away his voice.
Marcilly began to swear, and Badehorn to kick
at the door with his heavy boots; but realizing
that this was not the way to make things run
smoothly, and having no mind to have a brace
of slugs through me, I bade them desist, and
called out loudly that we were belated travellers
in search of a night’s lodging, and that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>were prepared to pay handsomely for the favor.
I had to repeat this twice, so furious was the
storm; but at last my voice reached the ears of
the clod above, and with a gruff “Wait,” he put
down the shutter and vanished.</p>

<p>“This will never do!” exclaimed Marcilly, and
he was about to sound a reminder on the door,
when we heard the dog yell as if being beaten
off, the clanking of chains, the dropping of a bar,
and the door opened, letting in a gust of wind
and a sheet of snow that all but extinguished the
torch held by a man in the hall. Behind his figure
we saw three or four others, farm-servants
apparently, armed with clubs and pitchforks. It
was no time to hesitate, however, and we stepped
in, while the farmer himself, a short, thickset
man, who carried a light axe in his hand, reassured
us at once.</p>

<p>“Step in, messieurs! Step in! ’Tis not a night
for a dog to be out, let alone honest men! Here,
Gondrin! Pierre! See after the horses! Come in,
gentlemen! You are not the first to-night&mdash;come
in! The horses shall be seen to.”</p>

<p>There was no doubting the honest tones of the
man’s voice, and, thanking him, we accepted his
invitation, leaving Badehorn to supervise the stabling
of the horses, a task from which he returned
well pleased with their lodging. Entering, we followed
our host into what was once the great hall
of the old château, but which was now apparently
a kitchen, a dining-room, and a <i>salon</i> in one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>As the farmer had said, we were not the first
who had sought the hospitable shelter of the
abbey farm that night. In a chair next to the
fire was a priest, evidently of high rank&mdash;I caught
the glitter of the ring on his hand&mdash;and close to
him were two or three of his following, all dark-robed
and sombre.</p>

<p>Some distance away, somewhat in shadow, and
at the extreme end of the table, where the fag-ends
of supper still remained, sat another wayfarer,
his head leaning on his arm, staring moodily
before him. On our entrance, this man gave a
quick glance at us, and then lowered his head
again, so that his features were not distinguishable.</p>

<p>The priest took no notice of us, bending low over
his breviary, but his suite returned our greetings
gravely, and looked at us with interest as
we took off our snow-bespattered cloaks, and
approached the warmth of the fire, while a brace
of brown-armed and dark-haired girls laid out
some supper&mdash;black bread and cheese, warm milk,
and a flagon of Rochecorbon; plain and homely
fare, but none the less welcome for all that.</p>

<p>On entering the room I had removed the demi-mask
I wore as a protection from the weather;
but it was not until we reached the full light of
the fire that Jean did so, and a look of surprise
and astonishment came into the eyes of our host.
He glanced from one to the other of us, his hands
began to tremble, and so discomposed did he appear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
that Jean thought it better to ask to be
allowed to sup at once, and, as we took our
seats, said something in an undertone to our
host, to which the man answered submissively,
in an equally low voice.</p>

<p>It was while this incident was in progress
that I caught the priest’s glance, and the slightly
amused, slightly mocking smile on his face. It
was clear that he had followed every detail of
the passage between Jean and the farmer of Larçon.
But it was the man’s expression, cold, sneering,
and haughty, that arrested me, and for a
moment we stared at each other. Then he bowed
to me as to an inferior, courteously but haughtily,
the jewel flashed brightly on his finger, and he
returned to his book, as if we did not exist. Yet
in that one look we exchanged I felt I had met a
master mind, and I had an instinctive foreboding
of ill to come from that stern and malign figure.</p>

<p>He was tall and thin, with a receding forehead,
an eagle nose, and a cruel line of red lip that contrasted
strangely with the pallor of his complexion.
But it was the searching light in the gray
eyes, flashing beneath the thick, straight brows,
that made me feel the man was reading me
like an open page. And a presentiment came
upon me, that here was one whose path would
cross mine to my destruction. I little imagined
what that crossing would mean to him, to that
man whose eyes were even now fixed on St.
Peter’s throne. Had Achon of Arles lived, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>not too much to say that the history of France
would have been altered, and the eagle of Lorraine
grasped the sceptre of my country. He possessed
every quality that the Cardinal and his
brother lacked. He equalled the Constable in
courage and the Italian in duplicity and cunning.
In a word, he was a great, bad man, such as a
nation sometimes produces to its sorrow and
often to its destruction.</p>

<p>As we took our seats at the supper table, I
noticed that the stranger I had first observed
had shifted his position, so that his face was
from us. At first I paid little heed to this, being
hungry, and a little diverted by our host’s strange
bearing. He looked at me knowingly, and seemed
swollen with the consciousness of possessing some
great secret. We were, however, relieved of his
importunities by the churchman, who summoned
him to receive some instructions, and it was then
that Marcilly took the opportunity to whisper:</p>

<p>“Do you recognize the priest?”</p>

<p>“Not I.”</p>

<p>“’Tis Achon, Abbot of St. Savin, and now
Bishop of Arles. He is St. André’s brother.”</p>

<p>“So that is Achon! He was at Lyons when I
was at the Court. I like not his look.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. We have met before, Gaspard, and he
does not forget, though it suits him, apparently,
not to recognize me. It was he who claimed the
Chaumont estates, which came to Marie, and he
is hand and glove with the Brothers. ’Tis even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>said that he holds the office of Inquisitor&mdash;I fear
we are in the wolf’s den.”</p>

<p>“There is another here who seems not to wish
to recognize any one,” and I indicated the bashful
stranger, whose back was toward us.</p>

<p>Marcilly was about to reply, when the Bishop
rose, and, escorted by the farmer, and followed
by his monks, passed down the room. We played
our parts and rose too, and as Achon went by
he stopped, and, looking Marcilly full in the face,
said:</p>

<p>“I trust Monsieur le Comte is well.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, monsieur, thanks. I hope to see
Monsieur of Arles at Orleans soon.”</p>

<p>“At Orleans!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I have begun to think it is well to
fly with the eagle.”</p>

<p>“It approaches closer to heaven, my son, than
the lily,” answered Achon. “I wish monsieur
good fortune, a fair flight, and good-night,” and
then, with a short benediction, he retired.</p>

<p>“The wolf shows his fangs. There is danger,
Gaspard.”</p>

<p>“Were you not reckless in saying you were
bound for Orleans?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. Candor is part of our game.
We no longer cry, ‘<i>Bourbon, Notre Dame!</i>’”</p>

<p>Shortly after the host returned, and Marcilly
rose, saying he was dog-tired and would go to
his chamber. The farmer began to apologize for
the accommodation he had to give us. “’Tis but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>a small room in the beacon tower I must ask
messieurs to share. My Lord Bishop has&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We understand, my good fellow, and we thank
you as if it were a royal palace. I’ll to bed, for
it grows late and we ride with the dawn. What!
Not coming, Gaspard?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” I answered, and Jean, with a cheery
“good-night,” and a point-blank refusal to allow
the host to accompany him, went off to sleep.</p>

<p>We heard him humming the “Lire, lire, lironfa”
as he tramped up the stairs, and then he called
for Badehorn.</p>

<span class="smaller">MONSIEUR OF ARLES MARKS THE KING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“M</span>on Dieu</span>! Messire!” said the farmer,
“but monsieur there is as like to Monseigneur
the Prince of Condé as one egg is to
another. I remember last year, when I was factor
of Beaulieu, how Monseigneur rode there once
from Romorantin, to enjoy the chase in the forest
of Loches.”</p>

<p>“So you have not been here long, then? Yet ’tis
an old house.”</p>

<p>“Messire! I am but the servant of the Bishop
of St. Aignan, whose abbey farm this is. I came
here but a year ago.”</p>

<p>“Then, in addition to your kindness, we are indebted
to Monsieur of St. Aignan for shelter to-night.”</p>

<p>“Speak not of that, messire! I would we had
better fare for you, who,” and he lowered his
voice as he added, “who serve the Prince.”</p>

<p>I replied in the same tone. “Ah, indeed! Your
information is extensive and your tongue loose,”
and I glanced at our moody companion, who,
however, took no notice of us.</p>

<p>“Pardon!” and the man spoke in whispers, “he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>sleeps, and will not hear. ’Tis some free companion
of the road, I fear. But, messire, I have not
forgotten a certain meeting in the woods of
Loches. In the dusk of the evening six gentlemen
met the Prince of Condé by the oak of King
Louis. You know the tree, with its trunk mottled
as if with leprosy, and spreading its arms
wide enough to shelter a company of horse!
These six gentlemen, I say, met the Prince, who
came alone, and they spoke it may be for an hour
together. The heads of four of the six now wither
on the spikes of the castle gates of Amboise. The
fifth was a great noble from the north, and the
sixth&mdash;he was, I remember now, the Sieur de
Vibrac, a gentleman of the Ruergue.”</p>

<p>“Hist! Fool! How do you know all this?”</p>

<p>“Messire, there was a man in the wood, who
had come there by chance and with no evil intent.
He was observed and seized. It was thought he
was a spy, and the Comte de Ste. Marie would
have slain him then and there with his poniard,
but you, messire, interposed and saved him. I
was that man. It was twilight at the time, and
even if it had not been dusk a noble like you
would not have remembered me. But I have not
forgotten, for life is dear, messire, and you gave it
to me once. And so I warn you. There is danger
here, and I am powerless to help.”</p>

<p>“The Bishop of Arles?” My voice was so low
it might have been the humming of a bee.</p>

<p>He but nodded his head, and I went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Consider your debt paid, and I thank you; but
we fear him not.”</p>

<p>“Ah, messire! He is bad, bad, and I dread him.”</p>

<p>“But we do not, and we will care for ourselves,”
and now, seeing that the man would talk for ever,
and being unwilling to exchange further confidences,
I raised my voice, saying, “Maître Pechaud,
for I believe that is your name, it grows late&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And Messire de Vibrac would retire. Pardon
my chattering. I will but show the way to the
chamber.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Yet stay! On second thoughts I will
not go now. I have some matters to think upon.
But let me not detain you.”</p>

<p>“Messire.”</p>

<p>“Let it be as I have said, Maître Pechaud. For
me it is not yet night,” and I lowered my voice
once more, saying, “it would perhaps be ill, if you
and I were seen gossiping together.”</p>

<p>“Messire is right. The chamber is on the third
story in the beacon tower, and the stairway in
the hall leads straight to it. It cannot be missed.
The flask is nearly full, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, messire!” and he retired, stopping
but for a moment to give a respectful greeting to
the surly stranger, who made no reply, but sat
like a stone, his square shoulders and broad back
turned toward us.</p>

<p>Though I observed this rudeness, and might at
another time have resented it as it deserved, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>did not do so now. My mind was full of other
things, and, for all I was concerned, the man was
no more to me than a chair or the big press that
concealed an angle of the room.</p>

<p>To be brief, it was not Pechaud’s warning, nor
the strangeness of our meeting that occupied me.
My thoughts were more about myself. I seemed
to be, as it were, two men in one; to have two
souls, one that was for ever combating, though
vainly, the other, and evil essence, that was
dragging me to the lowest deep. My nerves were
not right, and I had determined to spend the
night where I was rather than risk further temptation
by sharing Marcilly’s room. The bridge of
the Loup Garou was still fresh in my memory.
The horror of the thing I had so nearly done still
hung over me. I was afraid of myself. And so I
sat and brooded, whilst the snow pattered outside
against the glazing of the window, and the
logs crackled in the fireplace within. Finally I
became calmer, and as I looked around me I
noticed that the stranger was still there. I began
to be a little curious why he behaved in so odd a
manner. Was he, like myself one whose thoughts
gnawed at his vitals? I poured out some white
Rochecorbon, acid and thin it was, and toyed
with my cup. It was late, and the silence, broken
only by the plashing of the snow, and the sputtering
of the fire, became intolerable. I was determined
to solve the mystery, so, getting to my
feet and approaching my companion, I said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Monsieur! Will you do me the honor to
drink a cup with me?”</p>

<p>He rose as I spoke, looked me full in the face,
and holding out his hands burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Ah, Vibrac!” he said, “I thought to have tired
you out and got away unobserved; but it cannot
be, I see. A cup&mdash;two cups, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>I had gone back a half pace in astonishment;
for, as he rose, and spoke, I recognized my old
comrade-in-arms, Ponthieu, of the Trans-Alpine
Infantry. We embraced warmly, and were soon
by the fireplace pledging each other.</p>

<p>“To meet you, of all people, here!” I said.
“And on an affair, too. Else you had not been so
retiring.”</p>

<p>He nodded and became grave in a moment.
“Vibrac, you are with us, I know. You, too,
do not journey for pleasure on a night like
this.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “but let me give you a warning.
There is danger here. Get you gone with the
dawn, wherever you are bound.”</p>

<p>He sipped at his glass and looked at me keenly.
“Vibrac, I know that, and know too I can trust
you, although these are times when the father
betrays the son, the brother the brother; tell me
straight out, for old sake’s sake, are you still
with the white scarf?” He dropped his voice to a
whisper, and I nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“And the Dumb Captain?”</p>

<p>“<i>Ce petit homme tant joli.</i>” I quoted a line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>from the popular ballad the Huguenot soldiers
sang about Condé.</p>

<p>The Gascon’s tongue began to loosen now.</p>

<p>“Then, as of old, we are brothers-in-arms, and
I can ask you for help, for, my friend, I am in a
desperate strait.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“You know how affairs stand at Orleans?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is one chance, and only one chance,
of safety. It is with me. If I reach the Constable
in three days we may yet save the Prince. But
my horse is lame, dead lame. Had this not happened,
I would have gone through the storm&mdash;but
here I am, tied by the leg. Can you lend me
a horse?”</p>

<p>“I, too, have my business, Ponthieu, and life
hangs on that. We have no spare horse.”</p>

<p>“Then Condé dies,” he answered.</p>

<p>“An apple for your penny, Ponthieu&mdash;Condé
will not die.”</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers. “You little know the
Lorrainers. But I have that which would cut
their combs, had I but four swift hoofs beneath
me. See here, Vibrac! We are all hilt-deep in this
business. If Condé dies, we die. Think of something.”</p>

<p>I kicked at the fireplace with my boot, and
racked my brains until a thought&mdash;it was a forlorn
hope&mdash;struck me.</p>

<p>“I have no horse to lend, Ponthieu, but,” and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>smiled at the idea, “there is a chance. Perhaps
the Bishop of Arles has one in the stable. Why
not borrow it and go?”</p>

<p>He slapped his thigh and laughed out loudly, a
big, strong laugh.</p>

<p>“Blood of a Jew! as we used to say in the
Sicilies. Vibrac, you will die a marshal. The idea
is excellent, and there is no time like the present.
Ha! ha! ha!” and he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“It is too early&mdash;wait till the little hours. If
things go wrong, and the papers on you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never let your soup grow cold. It must be
now or never. If I am caught, ’tis but a blank
paper they will find; but you know the secret&mdash;a
trifle of water, and&mdash;<i>pff!</i> No! I will have no
help&mdash;you are mad, my good friend, think of your
own affair.”</p>

<p>“True!” I answered. “You are right; but take
my advice, and wait. You will lose your way&mdash;never
get through the storm.”</p>

<p>“Way or no way, storm or no storm, I must
risk it, and to-morrow Monsieur of Arles will have
to exercise some of that Christian resignation he
has no doubt often preached about.”</p>

<p>Nothing I could say would dissuade him, and I
more than regretted my speech. His preparations
were quickly made. He but buckled his sword
tighter, drank another cup of Rochecorbon, and
unbarred the window.</p>

<p>“It is cold,” he said, as he looked out, “and
snowing swords.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Be advised, Ponthieu!”</p>

<p>But he shook his head and wrung my hand.
Then he hung over the window for a moment,
and dropped into the snow. As I closed the shutter,
I saw him, a dark figure, crossing the dim
shaft of light that ran out into the night, and a
moment after he was lost in the dark. With a
shiver, I put up the bar, and turned back to my
seat at the fire.</p>

<p>I was alone now. Ponthieu had made no
allusion to our last meeting; but rough soldier as
he seemed, he was possessed of rare tact. And
now he had gone on his reckless mission. I had
given my right hand to have gone with him. It
was a jest worth the playing. But it was impossible.
I was bound to Marcilly, and the odds
were heavy enough against us to tempt the most
desperate gambler with life. With solitude my
thoughts came back to me and racked me. I had
sought for the bread of strength, and come back
with a stone. All this may be nothing to you
who pass by, but where could I turn for help? I,
who was fighting for my soul. As evil thoughts
steal into the heart like a fog, as good thoughts
come to us like sunlight through the mist, so
once again the light flashed on me, and I swore
to myself to tear up the past, and face my sorrows
like a man. Sleep was impossible. My
nerves were too strung for that. I leaned back,
and staring into the fire, began to think. My
dishonor was known but to myself, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>God’s grace I would win back my own self-respect.
The past could not come back; but there
was still the future&mdash;and hope. I would fight this
battle of the soul here to-night&mdash;here as I sat
alone. Alone, did I say? No; I had a hundred
companions. Out of the shadows in the room,
out of the dull red embers in the fireplace, out of
the forked flames they came in troops to me, gray
phantoms of sin and shame. There was one, that
red-handed spirit of murder, that could almost
hail me brother. There were others, winged regrets
that flitted to and fro. There were the
ghosts of high hopes and noble aspirations, that
floated before me with veiled faces and downcast
heads. But through all this the new-born
strength was coming to me. I would be true to
Marcilly, true to myself; and when it was over, if
I lived&mdash;well, the world was wide, and Gaspard
de Vibrac would find a new life in distant lands.
It was as if from afar a soft voice called to me,
“Come unto me, ye that are weary.” I sank on
my knees, and then&mdash;some one laughed behind me.
I sprang to my feet and faced round, and standing
before me was a tall, black-robed figure, with
a white face and shining eyes. It was Achon.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, the bitter laugh still on his
lips, “I want a word with you.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;” I stammered; I was completely
taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“That Achon of Arles was some one else,” he
put in; “you will see him in time, Monsieur de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>Vibrac, not yet. You will see him where hope
shall be cut off, and trust shall be as a spider’s
web.”</p>

<p>But I was myself by this. “Monseigneur! You
speak in riddles&mdash;and strangely, for a prince of the
Church.”</p>

<p>He looked at me keenly. “The Church&mdash;what
is it that you know of the Church, monsieur?
You, a heretic! You were praying. Think you
such prayers as yours are heard? You might as
well have cast them to the wind that howls outside.
It is the Church, the Church alone, that can
save you and yours, monsieur. But enough of
this! It is of other matters I came to speak, and,
to be brief, I overheard most of your talk with
your friend.”</p>

<p>I glanced at the large press that stood in the
corner of the room, and then at him.</p>

<p>“Precisely. You have uncommon intelligence.
There is a door behind that, and space to
stand.”</p>

<p>“And so you played the spy&mdash;well, what is your
point?”</p>

<p>His eyes flashed. “I am coming to that. It has
been my painful duty to have your friend arrested.
There were watchers by my poor mule. I have
no horse, but I am an old soldier.”</p>

<p>“Ponthieu has failed then?”</p>

<p>“Ponthieu has failed,” he repeated drily. “Ponthieu
is at present in safe hands, and to-morrow
Ponthieu will rest in the <i>cachots</i> of Loches&mdash;where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>I have a great mind to send you, Monsieur de
Vibrac.”</p>

<p>I flushed hotly, and my hand stole to the hilt
of my sword.</p>

<p>“Put back your hand, monsieur; a blow from
your sword would only kill a poor priest, but
you would be broken on the wheel, and you are
not yet ready to die. Even that poor fool, Ponthieu,
is better prepared than you, and as for
Marcilly&mdash;he has a good conscience and sleeps
soundly&mdash;but you&mdash;you cannot sleep.”</p>

<p>“Man! Be careful! There is danger in the air.”</p>

<p>“But not for me, de Vibrac&mdash;for you, perhaps,
who risk broad lands and an honorable name.
A moment ago the <i>cachots</i> yawned for you, but
now I have other plans.”</p>

<p>There was something in his air, in his haughty
speech and bearing, that overawed me. He was
reading me like an open page.</p>

<p>“I”&mdash;I began, but he stopped me with a wave of
his hand.</p>

<p>“Understand, monsieur, that I do not send
you to join Ponthieu because I have other
need of you. I have enough against you&mdash;even
against Marcilly&mdash;to have you both put to the
question, and to send you to the block&mdash;and you
know the Edict of Romorantin. If you forget
I will refresh your memory. Under the secret
clause, the punishment for all spiritual offences
remains in the hands of the bishops, and there is
one to whom our Lord the Pope and His Majesty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
have confided the trust of the Holy Office,
and he stands before you. But, I want you for
other things, as I said, and it has occurred to me
that it would be well if you appeared a free
agent.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, you are pushing too far.”</p>

<p>“Bah! This is an abbey farm of my brother
of St. Aignan, Vibrac, and I have gloves for the
cat. I have ten stout fellows with me. I lodged
them in the barns without for purposes of my
own. Six stand now in the hall, and you would
gain nothing by violence&mdash;you would be shot
down like a mad dog&mdash;you grasp the position?”</p>

<p>I did. I was a campaigner old enough to know
that I was outgeneralled, and my only chance
was to play fox against fox.</p>

<p>“I see,” Achon continued, “you are sensible.
You and Marcilly are going to Orleans. I could
make sure that you did go to Orleans, but I
will take a risk&mdash;I will let you go on one condition.”</p>

<p>There was all our game at stake. A false move
now and nothing could save us. The cards were
decidedly with the Bishop.</p>

<p>“The condition?”</p>

<p>“A very simple one&mdash;merely that you present
yourself to me, in the castle at Orleans at noon,
five days hence, and there, in the presence of Lorraine
and the Chancellor, repeat what Ponthieu
told you.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible&mdash;it would be too dishonorable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“I will put it another way&mdash;I will repeat what
Ponthieu told you, and I will ask you to bear
witness to my truth. Do you agree?”</p>

<p>“If I refuse?”</p>

<p>“The <i>cachots</i>&mdash;and the rack. Both you and
Marcilly.”</p>

<p>There was, truly enough, little choice in the
matter, and in five days many things might happen.
I could have slain him where he was, but
to what purpose? I watched him as he stood, a
whistle to his lips.</p>

<p>“Very well, monseigneur&mdash;I agree.”</p>

<p>“I have the word of Vibrac?”</p>

<p>I bowed. I could not trust myself to speak.</p>

<p>“That is right. The <i>cachots</i> are uncomfortable,
almost as uncomfortable as the Chausse d’Hypocras
of the Châtelet, where your friend the Vidame
is, though they say he has been moved to the
Tournelles.”</p>

<p>“One word, monseigneur! Ponthieu&mdash;he is my
friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He held up his jewelled hand. “Enough, monsieur!
I did not come here to discuss Ponthieu.
He is safe, and beware of any attempt at rescue.
As for his skin, it rests with himself to keep it,
as it rests with you to keep yours. One thing
yet, ere I go, de Vibrac, and I tell you this because
you are not quite like other men, and you
have interested me. We have met before, though
you do not recall it. But I know you&mdash;you have
trouble there,” and he touched me over the heart,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>and looked me in the face with keen, searching
eyes as he went on: “When you have done with
me at Orleans, go back and grow cabbages at
Vibrac for the rest of your life. You will be a
happier man.” He paused, and then continued:
“You start with the dawn. I wish you good
fortune, and dispense with the blessing, for you
are a heretic&mdash;and forget not&mdash;I can break you
with a turn of my little finger.”</p>

<p>He turned and went. Outside in the hall I
heard the shuffling of feet, and then all was silence.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT THE SIGN OF THE GREEN MAN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or</span> a moment I stood, thinking of Achon’s
last words, and then it all came back to me.
It was he who had played the mendicant friar in
Paris, that night when Lignières had died. It
was he who had got the letters and the scroll
of names. He was right. He held enough in his
hands to bring Marcilly and myself to the block,
and to ruin the honor of Marie. Then there was
Ponthieu&mdash;come what may, I was resolved that
he should have a blow struck for him. I felt as
if I was personally responsible for the ill-luck that
had overtaken him. But for what I had said he
would never have undertaken the rash enterprise
that had brought him to misfortune, and I could
not leave him to his fate. My mind had for the
moment righted itself, and I was once again Gaspard
de Vibrac. Other things also urged me powerfully.
The mortification of being outwitted and
browbeaten by the priest moved me to hot anger.
The shame of being overlooked and mocked at
during my struggle with myself burned in my
veins, and, mingled with the desire to do something
for Ponthieu, was a savage resentment
against Achon. It would have gone hard with
Monsieur of Arles, had we met at that juncture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Swelling like an asp with rage, and dagger in
hand, I stepped up to the press, passing between
it and the wall. There was the door by which
Achon had entered, and it was half open. He
had doubtless not closed it behind him when he
came in, for fear of any noise attracting our attention.
I cautiously pushed it back. Before me
lay a long and narrow corridor, half in darkness
and half in light. Up this I crept softly, feeling
on either hand for anything like a door. I was
confident that if I could find one, it would lead
to Achon’s apartment, and then I would show
him if de Vibrac feared to die. There was no result,
however, to my search. At last I was
brought to a standstill by a dead wall. I tapped
it gently with my fingers, placed my ear against
it, and searched the surface keenly, but with no
avail. My eyes could see nothing. My hand but
met the rough, uneven surface of the stonework.
The secret of the passage, wherever it was, was
too well concealed for me to discover in the short
time at my disposal, and disappointed, but not
despairing, I returned as I had come.</p>

<p>I resolved to seek Marcilly, and went out into
the hall. A small lantern burned there dimly,
and above me curled the brown spiral of the
stairway that led to our chamber. Taking the
lantern in my hand, I went up, and knocked
again and again at the door without receiving
any reply. A fear seized me that perhaps Marcilly
had come to harm; but just as I was about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>to put my shoulder to the door and attempt to
stave it in, I heard Jean’s voice.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Gaspard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I&mdash;&mdash;Open!”</p>

<p>The door swung back, and I saw Badehorn
sleepily rubbing his eyes and muttering apologies;
beyond him, Marcilly lay half-dressed on
the bed, his sword on a stool beside him.</p>

<p>As I put down the lantern and closed the door,
he said:</p>

<p>“What! Have you been keeping a vigil, or has
the bashful stranger proved good company at
last?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no, Marcilly; but something has happened,
while you and Badehorn slept like the
dead, and we must act.” And, sitting on the
bed beside him, I told him briefly, but clearly,
what had occurred. When I had done, he remained
silent for a moment, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“We can do nothing now!”</p>

<p>“But, Ponthieu&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon ami!</i> Ponthieu, and you, and I are playing
for our lives. If we lose the game, we pay
the stake. I understand how you feel in the matter;
but&mdash;and you know why&mdash;we cannot risk
anything now.”</p>

<p>“I know, and yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen! As I said, I know what you feel, and
were things otherwise, would have made a dash
to free him. But consider for a moment. We are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>now in the small hours. We know not our way
about this rambling house. We know not where
Ponthieu is lodged, and it would be simply courting
disaster to do what is in your heart. I think,
too, we can serve him best now by doing nothing
here, but using our influence at Orleans. Our Gascon
is too insignificant for much fuss to be made
about him, and a thousand écus of the sun would
free him&mdash;be tranquil!”</p>

<p>“I see you are right, but I have so much on
my soul already. I would give the lands of Vibrac
to free Ponthieu.”</p>

<p>Marcilly laughed as he rose from the bed. “Your
nerves are unstrung, Gaspard. This comes of not
sleeping; as for your trouble of conscience, I
would give much to change the weight on my
soul, friend, for that which lies on yours&mdash;you
will look back in ten years, and smile at your
burden of to-day.”</p>

<p>I turned my head aside, but he went on: “There
is one thing that troubles me, and that is your
promise to Achon. Edict or no edict, we can
laugh at his threats, and for these we will burn
his Abbey of St. Savin over his head the next
ride we take with Rambures’ Horse&mdash;but your
promise&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It must be kept.”</p>

<p>“You will have to ride post from Poitou to
do so”&mdash;he was dressing as he spoke&mdash;“but, Ste.
Croix! What a fool I have been! I doubt if you
will ever do that ride, Gaspard. Do you not see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>what this meeting at Orleans five days hence
means?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It is clear as daylight to me. Achon is hilt-deep
with the Guise in their plans. ’Tis more than
whispered that he is the brain behind the Cardinal.
He overheard your conversation with Ponthieu.
He knew that the letter the Gascon carried
concerns the safety of the Prince. He has
the letter with him now, presumably, and Ponthieu
has given away the secret of reading a blank
paper. Yet this meeting between Lorraine and
the Chancellor&mdash;sworn enemies until now&mdash;is to
take place five days hence; do you begin to see?”</p>

<p>“I think so; you mean that the execution of
the sentence against Condé is delayed.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. And this goes with what I told
you before. There will be delays. We shall have
more time than we thought we had, and we shall
save Condé. <i>Parbleu!</i> You will attend the meeting
before starting for Poitou, and now for the
hour.”</p>

<p>He buckled on his sword and, stepping to the
window, opened the shutter. The storm had
passed. It had ceased snowing, and morning
was at hand. The forest lay beneath us, but we
could make out nothing except a confused mass of
dun shadow, streaked here and there with patches
of white. Above it shifted an uneasy sea of cloud,
through which, in the distant west, still glimmered
the beacon fire on Beaulieu. Above the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>clouds there was a faint light, which, weak as
it was, paled the glow of the lantern, and as we
looked, a cock crowed shrilly.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Marcilly; “day at last! It
is time to start. Badehorn&mdash;the horses.”</p>

<p>And in a half-hour we were trotting through the
snow toward Chenonceaux.</p>

<p>Our way was still through the chill arcades of
the forest, yet dripping with melting snow. At
first we were almost numbed with the cold, but
the quick motion soon warmed our blood. Each
moment it became lighter, and there was every
prospect of the mild winter of the Land of Quinces
giving us a fair day, such a storm as that of the
night being unusual in the Orléanais. Although
I had not slept, my mental excitement kept me
unwearied; the interest of the adventure had
seized hold of me, and in the struggle I had with
myself I believed I had cast off the serpent’s skin
of disloyal thought to my friend, and had no fear
that I would reclothe myself in it. Now and
again I was haunted by the recollection of Ponthieu;
but I could not help reflecting that Marcilly
was right, and that the best thing for my poor
friend was to wait until we reached Orleans, and
there use our influence, which was not small, to
get him freed. It was running a risk, and it
would have been more to my taste to have cut
for him with the sword; but we did not even
know where he was confined, and our enterprise
would not permit us to linger on the heels of time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>I say this in defence of what might otherwise
have seemed unworthy conduct on my part. In
this miserable confession of my folly and sin I
have been utterly honest, and I cling, God alone
knows why, to the memory of every small action
that goes to show I was once not wholly lost.</p>

<p>What Marcilly was thinking of I know not.
Perhaps in this early dawn he was reflecting on
the sacrifice he was about to make. As far as
he was concerned, he was going to almost certain
death. Mayhap some thought of this was working
in his mind, as for once his cheery light heart
seemed to have left him, and he rode with his
head held down and his hat pulled over his
brow.</p>

<p>And so we went on in silence through the gray
morning, and keeping Chartreuse du Liget to our
right, we at length saw the mouldering old church
of Genille, built in the eleventh century, and knew
then that the Indroye was at hand, and the tortuous
passage of the forest coming to an end.
We crossed the Indroye by the bridge below Genille,
and in a mile or so had entered the Champeigne,
the chain of barren clay hillocks that separates
the valley of the Cher from that of the
Indre.</p>

<p>“There is the Etang de la Gauvrie,” exclaimed
Marcilly, rousing himself, and pointing to a blue
splash below us; “that little stream trickling
from it falls into the Cher at Chenonceaux. It
is full of fat waterfowl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Was it not in the reeds on the banks that
Coqueville hid for two days after Amboise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and but escaped by a hair. St. Gris! But
this is a stiff descent!”</p>

<p>We were on the top of a table-land as we spoke,
and the descent wound steeply down to the lake,
and it was near the end of this that a slight misfortune
befell us. I was riding a little behind,
and Marcilly turned in his saddle to say something.
At this moment his horse stumbled and
fell, bringing his rider down with him. He was
on his feet in a moment, however, and was examining
the horse’s hoof, as I came alongside
and anxiously asked:</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, Gaspard; but the very devil of ill-luck dogs
us. The horse is lame.”</p>

<p>“It is a good omen, though, that you have escaped.”</p>

<p>“True enough! But the delay.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be helped, Fortunately Chenonceaux
is at hand. Take Badehorn’s horse, and let
us hasten on. We will get another beast
there.”</p>

<p>Badehorn had dismounted ere this, and Marcilly
jumped on his nag. Bidding him lead the
lame horse to the Green Man, at Chenonceaux,
we pushed on with all the speed the country permitted,
and in a little under an hour were in the
parlor of the inn, awaiting the coming of Badehorn
and the return of a messenger whom we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>had sent for horses. I forced myself to eat something,
and while my friend lay back in his chair
and exercised his patience by staring at the logs
crackling in the fireplace, I stretched myself on a
settee near the window and looked wearily out
through the glazing. The window opened on the
little square of the village, now crowded with
people, for it was market day, and beyond rose
the gray donjon, the towers and galleries of the
château of Chenonceaux, built by Bohier, the Receiver-General
of Normandy, on the remains of an
old fifteenth-century fortress. The financier died
before the building was completed, and his son,
the Baron de St. Cyergue, a man of egregious
vanity, made the château a gift to La Valentinois,
who, on her downfall, was forced to part
with it for a song to Catherine de Medicis, for
whom it was held now by Monsieur de Rabutin,
a gentleman of the Tarantaise. I had not met
St. Cyergue since the affair in the Bouton d’Or.
News had, however, reached us that having totally
lost his fortune, he had retired to a small
house he owned at Chenonceaux; though whenever
he could scrape together a hundred crowns
or so, he returned to take his place among the
hangers-on of the Court. So, while idly recalling
these things, I dropped off to sleep, until I
was suddenly aroused by a loud laugh, and, starting
up, saw a man, extravagantly dressed, engaged
in converse with Marcilly. It needed but
a look at the vacant face, the protruding eyes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>the puffed breeches, the scarlet cloak, and the
faded gold lace of the coat-of-arms embroidered
on the left breast of his pourpoint, to tell it was
St. Cyergue himself.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” he exclaimed. “So you are awake
at last! Faith! I thought you were sleeping as
soundly as poor Lignières does at St. Merri&mdash;we
buried him there, you know.”</p>

<p>“Let that matter rest, St. Cyergue,” I said, but
he went on:</p>

<p>“It was neat&mdash;devilish neat, Marcilly. <i>Ca! Ca!</i>
And he had our wit, our duellist Lignières, spitted
like a lark, and he never spoke again. I
only saw that thrust equalled once, when Richelieu&mdash;the
man they call ‘The Monk’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Baron has just left the Court,” interrupted
Marcilly, forcing a change in the talk.
“He confirms what we heard about Condé.”</p>

<p>“That is good news if it remains true. And
how long have you been here, Baron?”</p>

<p>“I arrived but last night, though it seems a
year. I lost a thousand écus of the sun to de
Billy, and it has become necessary to take a
change of air until my rents come in.”</p>

<p>“St. Cyergue puts it down to the écus, Gaspard,”
said Marcilly, “but we know better. A
few paltry crowns would not drive the Baron
from Court. Come, tell us, Baron.”</p>

<p>“There are things one does not speak of, messieurs,”
he said, with a simper, and winked his
hare-like eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Quite right, St. Cyergue! Though I little
thought you would ever be a conspirator.”</p>

<p>“Conspirator! I! <i>Diable!</i> But you mistake.
It was an affair&mdash;a grand dame, if you must
know.”</p>

<p>“Keep your secret, Baron. Yet such a man as
you are must have his hands full of affairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! No! Perhaps one or two; but that
is all. Still, there was something of excitement
about this one, and, as we are all friends here,
I will tell you. You know de Semiers&mdash;tall, thin,
with a nose like a vulture, and a heart as jealous
as a Spaniard’s. Well, he raised a fuss about
madame, and we had a pass or so on the parvis
of Ste. Croix. He was a child in my hands,
I assure you, and in the shake of a sparrow’s
tail it was all over, and monsieur was pinked
through the ribs, and will have to keep his bed
for a month. Now, <i>mordioux!</i> as the Gascons
say, what do you think happened? Madame herself
made an outcry; your uncle Cipierre sent his
Swiss after me; and it would have gone hard
with St. Cyergue, I assure you, but for that business
at the storming of Calais, when I drove the
English back, and another I will not name took
the credit. So what with this, and my losses at
play, I judged it best to retreat for a time. But
you must sup with me to-night; I have some
rare old Romanée, soft as velvet, and as light as
air.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks, but I fear we cannot have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>that honor, Baron. We but await fresh horses
to push on to Orleans.”</p>

<p>He was still pressing us, however, when the
landlord made his appearance to say that Badehorn
had arrived, and he added to this the bad
news that other horses were not procurable in
Chenonceaux. Perhaps, however, if we sent to
Bléré, of Montrichard, we might get them by to-morrow.</p>

<p>“What!” I said; “it is market day. Your yard
is humming with clients. All the countryside is
here, and no horses for sale or hire?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur can judge for himself. They have
asses and mules enough, but no horses for sale
or hire&mdash;it is indeed true.” And then he added,
as if with an inspiration, “Perhaps Monsieur de
Rabutin would be able to lend you horses, messieurs.”</p>

<p>“The Governor of the Château?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, the horses of the Queen-Mother are
there.”</p>

<p>“It is worth trying,” I began; but now St.
Cyergue stepped in to rescue us from our difficulty,
and very good-naturedly offered to lend
us two horses of his own, adding at the same
time that they were gifts to him from the Duke
of Guise.</p>

<p>And hardly waiting for our acceptance, he bade
the landlord fetch them at once from his house.
I confess, however, that until the beasts actually
appeared, I had some small doubts of my own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>of their existence. As to their being a present
from Guise, that was of a piece with the tales of
his other adventures, the conceit of the man being
such, that he surrounded every moment of his
life with imaginary exploits, which he fully believed
he had himself performed. Nevertheless his
good nature was so great that he would have
divided his last livre with a total stranger, had
he been asked, and it was in this way that he
had been wheedled out of the fine estate of Chenonceaux
by Madame La Grande Seneschale,
whose avarice was as great as her effrontery.
We had, of course, no intention of profiting by his
easy disposition, and knowing he was in straits,
and being unwilling to borrow his nags, we prevailed
upon him to sell them to us for a hundred
crowns apiece, which, after some demure, that
the price we offered was too great, our friend
finally accepted. We would still have to take
one of our own horses with his two, but Badehorn
rode a light weight, and we had but a bare
twenty leagues before us, as the crow flies, to
reach Orleans. It was now past midday, so,
leaving the remaining two of our beasts with
St. Cyergue, we mounted and prepared to set
out, having hopes to reach Nanteuil by evening,
where we could rest the horses and ourselves in
the house of M. de Villequier.</p>

<p>Wishing the Baron good-by and a speedy termination
of his temporary exile, and bearing from
him a number of confused messages to the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
personages in France, which we promised
faithfully to deliver, we rode out of the crowded
courtyard of the Green Man into the little square
of Chenonceaux, at the same moment that M. de
Rabutin, the Captain of the Castle, who was taking
an airing on foot, with a half-dozen of his
friends, entered it at the other end.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW PONTHIEU CARRIED THE ADMIRAL’S LETTER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was market day, as I have said, and the little
square was full to overflow with a chaffering,
haggling crowd, that pressed round the shelter
of the shops, and squeezed, pushed, and shouted
about the stalls and booths erected in the open,
on the rough and still sleet-covered cobble-stones
of the uneven pavement. We made our way slowly
through the heaving mass of red-faced and brown-handed
country folk, all talking at the same time,
and in the same breath retailing some gossip of
the hamlet side, and holding fast to a deal, or
throwing in a prayer to St. Jean of Bléré, as
they beat down a price.</p>

<p>We rode past pigs, cattle, and sheep, booths full
of leather work from Château Renault, rough
pottery from Tours and the Sologne, woollen material
from Amboise, iron and copper ware, and
cheap haberdashery from Blois and Orleans.
There were stalls where chestnuts were roasting,
and a warm wheat cake, a handful of hot chestnuts,
and a draught of fresh milk were to be had
for a brown piece. We were detained for a moment
by an altercation between some soldiers of
the garrison and a sutler from Montrichard, who
had tried to palm off on them a skin of white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>Joué as a true Cote d’Or, and but escaped this
to fall under the eye of a mad friar, who had
climbed on to a cart laden with rye, or buckwheat
flour, and from that elevation denounced
the vengeance of heaven on the sins of Chenonceaux.
His glance fell on us, and we at once became
subjects for his invective. We, of course,
took no notice, and pushed on, to find, this time,
that we were completely hemmed in by a crowd
that rushed to form a ring round a juggler, who
prepared to show his wonders, while his companion,
a black-eyed, dark-browed, and comely
Arlesienne, beat a tambour, as she sang the shepherd’s
song of her country to the morning star,
“La Belle Maguelonne,” and coppers flew thick
and fast. I thought that we had shown sufficient
consideration to these <i>canaille</i> in not riding
some of them down ere this, and was about to
vent my impatience, when I was checked by Marcilly.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon ami!</i>” he said; “let them be&mdash;these are the
bread-winners of France.”</p>

<p>I knew he was right, and, feeling the reproof,
reined back from him. We were, however, relieved
from our difficulty by M. de Rabutin and his
friends, who, using their canes freely for their
own passage, soon caused the crowd to surge
back, and opened a way for us.</p>

<p>We rode forward, and would have passed de
Rabutin and his companions, but, perhaps a little
excited, they stood before our horses, still flourishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
their canes and wearing a threatening aspect,
until Marcilly called out:</p>

<p>“Have a care, de Rabutin! Do you not know
us?”</p>

<p>“Jean de Marcilly, as I live, and de Vibrac too!”
exclaimed de Rabutin, dropping his cane. “Where
in the world have you sprung from, and where
do you ride?”</p>

<p>“To Orleans, de Rabutin, and we are hard
pressed, else we had stayed at the château for a
cup of d’Arbois.”</p>

<p>“And heartily welcome! Will you not do so
now?”</p>

<p>“I fear we cannot, for our time is short, and
we would have to fight the great St. Cyergue,
whose invitation we have been compelled to refuse
as well.”</p>

<p>The Captain of Chenonceaux laughed, and insisted
on walking by us as far as the bridge,
over which he said he would give us safe conduct.
We stopped on the other side to say farewell,
when we were startled by a sudden roar of
voices that came from behind, and, turning round,
saw the crowd swaying and parting before a
mounted man, who, bareheaded, white-faced, and
spattered with mud, urged his horse through the
press, now striking to the right, then to the left,
with the flat of his drawn sword.</p>

<p>It was Ponthieu, as I lived! Ponthieu, who
had somehow escaped the clutches of Achon, and
was making a brave bid for freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Name of the devil!” roared de Rabutin. “Stop
him! Seize him!”</p>

<p>There were half a dozen mounted men at the
bridge close to us, and in an instant swords had
flashed out, and the way was barred, but it was
all or nothing now, and with a reckless shout of
“<i>Bourbon, Notre Dame!</i>” Ponthieu spurred across
the bridge and came straight for us.</p>

<p>Things that take but a moment to happen
should take but a moment to tell. Our swords
were out, too, now; but we cut for Ponthieu as
he came up, and he dashed into us in the confusion
caused by our sudden assault in his favor.
Marcilly’s reins were seized by de Rabutin with
a cry of “Traitor,” but Jean leaned forward and
struck the Tarantaise with the hilt of his sword,
and he fell backward, but rose staggering to his
feet. Ponthieu was hard pressed. Once he thrust
at me, and it was but chance that I managed to
turn his point. At another time he was all but
overpowered, but I ran the trooper who was on
him through, and the man fell forward with a
sob.</p>

<p>“Courage, Ponthieu!” I cried, and then he recognized
me.</p>

<p>“Good friend!” he said, and the next moment
we were free.</p>

<p>“Gallop! Gallop!” It was Jean’s voice at my
bridle-rein, but we needed no word to urge us as
we dashed forward, Ponthieu at my right hand
and Badehorn, who had cunningly got clear at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>the beginning of things, a good quarter-mile
ahead.</p>

<p>Ah! But it was with a glad heart that I rode
on. I had felt Ponthieu’s fate to be like a mill-stone
round my neck, and now he was free, and
it was my sword that had helped to free him!
It was to me an omen of the future, and for very
lightness of soul I could have turned back for
yet another pass with de Rabutin’s men, who
came pressing behind, cursing as they fired their
pistols after us in vain.</p>

<p>We all but gave them the slip in the forest of
Amboise. Here, while we galloped through the
withered, but wet and dripping underwood, tearing
our faces and hands with the thorns and
overhanging branches, the gray tree trunks flitted
by like shadows, and the white snow-covered
glades seemed to open and shut like fans as we
sped past them. Beneath us we could hear the
breathing of the horses, and behind came shout
and halloo, answered by a hundred echoes, until
the dim forest seemed to ring again with the
voices of those who sought our death. But our
horses went fast, and we rode hard, for safety
lay in front and there was no mercy behind, and
at last cry and echo died away, and there was
a silence. We had distanced them, as we thought,
and we pulled up for a moment to breathe the
nags.</p>

<p>“We must take to the open Sologne if we wish
to reach Nanteuil,” said Marcilly, loosening a holster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
flap, and, turning sharply to our right, we
trotted out of the cover of the trees into the
rough moorland.</p>

<p>It was a necessary but unfortunate thing, for
as we rode out we were spied once more by the
troopers, and with a yell they came on. It was
perhaps well for us that there were not more
than about a half-dozen of them. As I turned
in my saddle to glance back, I noticed that there
was but this number at our heels, and could we
but reach the Beuvron there was every chance
of safety among the yoke elms and chestnuts
of Russy. For ourselves, I felt this was possible,
but as I looked at Ponthieu, and saw the heaving
flanks of his horse, I began to fear for the
issue of our ride. It would, of course, be impossible
to desert him now; at any hazard we must
stand or fall together. The Gascon caught my
eye as I looked up from his horse and laughed
at me.</p>

<p>“There is a half-mile or so in him yet, Vibrac,”
and he swung his sword, and hallooed the horses
on.</p>

<p>We had a good start, but our beasts were already
nearly blown, and we began to feel that
the end could not be far.</p>

<p>“We must fight at the Masse,” said Marcilly,
as he brought his nag with an effort alongside
mine.</p>

<p>“Now, if you like,” I answered; but he shook
his head, and pointed before him to the low line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>of willows that showed where the Masse crept.
How we rode for those few hundred yards! How
the very horses seemed to know the danger behind!
And somehow we managed it, all four of
us, though, as we splashed out of the stream and
up the opposite bank, our pursuers were not more
than a hundred paces away. As we gained the
bank, Ponthieu sprang from his saddle, pistol in
hand.</p>

<p>“Go on friends!” he said; “my horse is beaten,
and you have risked too much for me already&mdash;save
yourselves!”</p>

<p>But Jean laughed as he faced round, and we
four of us, brought to bay, waited for de Rabutin.
After he was felled by Marcilly, he must have
seized a trooper’s horse and followed us, and we
could see him now, utterly weaponless, riding well
ahead of his men, his face red with the blood of
his wound, and his pourpoint splashed and torn.
As they came up, however, his men, seeing we
were determined to fight to the last, that we were
well armed and desperate, wavered and hesitated.</p>

<p>Not so did Rabutin; he was mad with anger,
and shrieked at them as they slackened rein, and
began to move forward slowly.</p>

<p>“Cowards! Dogs! Would you halt now? See,
there are but four of them! On! On! God save
me! Am I followed by a pack of serving-wenches
or men-at-arms?”</p>

<p>And as he stormed, Marcilly shouted to him:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>“Go back, de Rabutin! We have no quarrel with
you. Go back!” But the sound of Jean’s voice
seemed to drive him to frenzy.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;” he said, shaking his clenched
fist at us, and, all swordless as he was, plunged
into the stream, followed for very shame by his
men.</p>

<p>Our hands were being forced, and I felt that
what was to follow would not be on our heads;
but now Jean raised his pistol and shot de Rabutin’s
horse dead, and man and beast together
fell into the icy water of the Masse. His men
needed no further inducement to retreat than the
fall of their leader, and, turning rein at once for
the opposite shore, galloped off leaving de Rabutin
to his fate. He managed to scramble to
the bank thoroughly cooled by his drenching, and
wishing him a pleasant walk back to Chenonceaux&mdash;a
good wish that he answered with a
curse&mdash;we rode on, now thanking our lucky stars
at our escape, now laughing at the sorry figure
poor de Rabutin cut as he crawled out of the
water.</p>

<p>“We have made an enemy for life,” said Marcilly,
“and the worst of it is that the Tarantaise has
something of right on his side. He will make the
Court ring with his complaints.”</p>

<p>“And we with laughter, as we tell how monsieur
took a bath in the Masse ere he walked to
Chenonceaux,” I answered.</p>

<p>“As for right on his side,” said Ponthieu, “<i>Cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
de Diou!</i> He holds no commission as a catch-poll.
What right had he to hunt us to death
like a stag. My faith! It was in my heart to
have ended his hunting for all as he struggled in
the water.”</p>

<p>The Gascon had excuse for what he said, and,
as we crossed the Bievre, that little child of the
Beuvron, we slackened pace, now feeling secure
from further pursuit, and Ponthieu, who had completely
regained his spirits and good temper, told
us how he escaped.</p>

<p>“You must know, friends,” he said, “that when
I dropped out of the window, I knew no more
than the road to the moon where I was, but after
some groping I reached the stable where my lame
nag stood. He was close to yours, and for once
I was tempted to take the chance Providence had
thrown to my hand, and assist myself to one of
your beasts.”</p>

<p>“If you had, Ponthieu&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We would not have been such good friends as
we are now, but I should have been within a
league of Yvoy le Marron, where the Constable
lies. To make the story short, I resisted the
temptation for our friendship’s sake, de Vibrac,
and sought the next stall, to find there a mule&mdash;a
yellow mule as I live&mdash;nevertheless he seemed a
stout beast, and would serve at a pinch. I looked
round to see if any one was by, but there was no
one watching, so I made a shift to go back to my
own horse to fetch his saddle. As I came out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>the stall into the flagged passage, a light suddenly
flashed before my eyes, and some one struck at
me. I started back, luckily, or else I had never
spoken again, but the blow grazed my good steel
cap, and sent me flying. The next moment I was
seized and pinned down. I made a struggle for it,
as you may think, and shouted out for help, the
Lord knows why, for I knew well enough there
was no help at hand; but all was useless. There
were four men against me&mdash;stout fellows&mdash;and in
a twinkling I was gagged and bound. Then they
took away my arms and money, and searched me.
But they did not find what they wanted, and at
last one of them flashed the lantern again in my
face as he asked me roughly:</p>

<p>“‘Where is the letter?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! ho!’ I said to myself, as it came to me
in a moment that there was more in this than I
thought, and that there must have been a traitor
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“The traitors were our own tongues, Ponthieu;
every word of our talk was overheard by Achon.”</p>

<p>He looked at me, his black eyes staring with
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Overheard! Impossible! There was not a soul
in the room.”</p>

<p>“We both forgot that big press, Ponthieu.
Achon lay in wait behind that. But go on with
your story. I will tell you mine later on.”</p>

<p>“<i>Cap de Diou!</i> That explains things,” he said.
“And to go on. At the demand for the letter, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>thanked the saints in my heart that the Admiral
had given me a decoy duck, an empty sealed
packet, which I had sewn in my vest, while the
real letter, the blank paper itself, lay on the inside
of the sole of my boot.”</p>

<p>“Then Achon never got that?” I eagerly asked.</p>

<p>Ponthieu laughed as he stuck out his left foot.
“It is here,” he said, as he went on: “I, of course,
could not answer, but mumbled something under
the gag, and, seeing this, they undid the bandage,
and asked the question again, the man who had
first spoken saying that if I would keep my skin
I had best speak out at once. I pretended to be
overcome with fear, and told them of the letter,
begging with a trembling voice for my life. They
cut open my vest in a moment, and when they
found the letter, I began to implore and entreat
again for my life, saying I would tell all if they
would but free me.</p>

<p>“‘Ugh!’ said one of them, as he gave me a kick.
‘’Tis the whitest-livered cur I have seen&mdash;the
<i>cachots</i> are too good for him&mdash;he is best in the
stocks.’</p>

<p>“Then, despite my protestations, they gagged
me again, and flung me into the loft of the stables,
bidding me lie there till the morning, and though
I ached with the pain of the cords, I laughed in
my heart to think that my letter was safe as yet.
<i>Boun!</i>” he exclaimed, with his strong southern
accent, “<i>Boun!</i> It was safe as yet; but for how
long! That I could not tell. Through the chill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>hours I lay there, till I heard the cock crow, and
there was a bustle, and you all departed. I could
hear your voices but could neither speak nor
move.”</p>

<p>“By heaven! If we had known you were so
close, Ponthieu, we would have struck a blow
for you then.”</p>

<p>“You have done so now, to make amends,” he
said, as he continued: “About a half-hour after
you were gone, my friends returned and, setting
me on a horse, we rode off in the direction of
Loches. I forgot to say they had removed my
gag, and the ropes from my feet, though my
hands remained securely tied. Beyond Beaulieu
we met the Princess of Condé and her suite on the
way to Orleans.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Marcilly and I in a breath.</p>

<p>“Eh!” said Ponthieu, “you seem surprised, but
it is as I said.”</p>

<p>“<i>Souvent femme varie</i>,” muttered Jean, under
his breath, as I hastened to ask:</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Ponthieu?”</p>

<p>“Sure as I live! It was near the King’s Oak,
where the road through the forest turns sharply
toward the west. My guards thought me safe
enough, for Loches was in sight. Two of them
were a little in front of me laughing and singing,
two rode behind, and in this manner we were going
at a walk, when at the elbow of the road we
came face to face with a half-dozen cavaliers, and
the leading horseman was Coqueville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“All through the morning I had been looking
for some chance to make a dash for it. When we
met, the two parties were not fifty yards apart,
and if I could only slip past them, I knew that
in the confusion I would get a start, and the luck
that favors the brave might favor me.</p>

<p>“All this went through me in a moment. I put
spurs to my horse, and, giving a yell, went forward
like a flash. I got behind Coqueville, calling
loudly out to him by name for help, and then
my horse stumbled, and I rolled over like a log
into the brambles.</p>

<p>“But the good God was with me. I was not
hurt, by a mercy. Coqueville knew my voice, and
<i>ma foi!</i> But he is a great sword. While I lay in
the brambles I heard the kicking and plunging of
horses, the clash of steel, and twice the sharp reports
of a pistol. My guards were taken by surprise,
but the bishop is well served, and they made
a brave fight of it. Two lay dead in the snow,
and two, beaten from their horses, had surrendered.
I thought it was time to appear now, so
scrambled up, and began to pour out thanks,
while the cords that bound my hands were cut
by a Moorish dwarf.”</p>

<p>“Majolais!”</p>

<p>“I know not his name, but, once free, I helped
myself to a sword from one of the dead men, and
explained how I stood. The Princess was there in
her litter, and she herself told me that she was for
Orleans but that Monsieur de Lanoy had taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>the young Prince on to Poitou. She wished me
God-speed on my errand to the Constable, Coqueville
gave me one of the captured horses, and lent
me ten écus&mdash;and you can guess the rest. But
now, messieurs, here is the forest of Russy, and
here is the Beuvron, and here we must part, for
I lie to-night at Bracieux, and to-morrow must be
with the Constable.”</p>

<p>He shook our hands, thanked us again, and,
turning toward the northeast, trotted off into
the forest.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> had reined up under a huge yoke-elm,
whose spreading branches threw a mottled
shade on the snow at our feet, and watched
Ponthieu in silence until he went quite out of our
sight. The same thoughts were running in our
minds. Perhaps something too of the same despair
had seized us, a presentiment that we were
casting away our lives for nothing. Madame de
Condé had at one stroke, by changing her plans,
gone straight into the lion’s mouth, and had increased
tenfold the difficulty of our emprise, if
not totally destroying all chances of its success.
And yet, now that I look back upon things, I
cannot blame her. She was a woman, after all,
and guided more by the heart than the head.
But then, as we stood there, I railed against the
caprice that was like to cost us all our lives.</p>

<p>“Did ever you hear the like?” I burst out, and
Marcilly laughed bitterly as he answered:</p>

<p>“We go like lambs to the slaughter, perchance,”
and then he looked me straight in the face, saying:</p>

<p>“Gaspard! You see that track! It leads
straight to the high road to Blois. Turn rein and
ride there, and thence take horse to Poitou.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>There is blood in the air, friend, but it must not
be yours. Leave me! I will do this alone.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” I said, a flush rising to my face,
and, as God is my witness, the words I uttered
came straight from my heart, “Monsieur, I have
the honor to be joined with you in this thing,
and I stay with you till the last, for good or ill.”</p>

<p>“Think!” he said, “and draw back while there
is time. Where are Renaudie, Castelnau, and Ste.
Marie? Where are a hundred brave hearts we
knew and loved?”</p>

<p>“Where we shall be if we fail. I will not go.”</p>

<p>“Your lands are broad, Vibrac. You are young,
and life is dear.”</p>

<p>“My life is my own, and neither my lands nor
yours of Duras were won with dishonor. And
for the risk&mdash;I&mdash;I but stake myself, while you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I said no more, for he knew what I meant, and
his brown cheek paled. As for me, for that moment
I was innocent, I had conquered the past,
and for once the dread breath that stirred the
fires of evil within me lost its malign power. The
whispering presence was there, ready as ever, but
I was strong then. Would that that strength had
continued! Ah! God in Heaven! Why dost Thou
not stoop a little lower to help Thy creatures?
And now I put aside the fiend with a curse, and
swore again and again that I would die with
Marcilly if need be, and we clasped hands once
more on my oath, as we rode through the twilight
of the woods of Russy, through the red sunset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
that lit up the old and gnarled trunks, and
bronzed the tracery of branches overhead; a
strange glow, that flushed the snow beneath us,
that ran on the crests of the trees in a line of
flame, and, falling on the gray of the distant
woodlands, lit them with its glory, to sink at
last in a trembling veil of empurpled shadows.</p>

<p>What thoughts stirred Marcilly I know not;
but as I rode behind him, I was once more fighting
with myself. I saw with horror that the past
was still awake within me, and there was a black
foreboding in my soul of evil to come. Again I
clutched at the strength above me, again bent my
head in silent prayer. I swore to myself that I
would put to flight the hideous phantom that
dogged me, and once more there came to me
that momentary strength, that feeble power,
that faints so weakly at the first stealthy footfall
of temptation.</p>

<p>Were other men like me, I wondered, or was I
accursed beyond my fellows, one marked with the
Mark of the Beast?</p>

<p>Good would it have been if I had taken Jean’s
offer, and turned rein to Blois. The bitter days
that were to come had then perchance never been;
but my word was passed, and I would not draw
back for dread of my life. It would be said that
Gaspard de Vibrac had feared to die with his
friend, that he had fled like a frighted roe at the
first rustle of the leaves. It would be no longer
the Fever of St. Vallière, but the Sweat of Vibrac,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>that would brand a poltroon with infamy. No!
It could not be! And so, against myself, I drifted
with the tide, into that yawning abyss from
which there is no return.</p>

<p>I had once put the past to sleep as I thought.
Fool that I was! The past never sleeps. The
madness had come on me again, and again I had
crushed it, as I imagined, in that lonely struggle
with myself which he, who was a priest of his
people, had mocked at and gibed. And was this
horror to envelop me again? God forbid! No!
A thousand times no! I would play this last
game to the end of my sword, and then&mdash;farewell
to France.</p>

<p>I longed, yet feared, to meet Marie. I felt my
bridle hand shiver as I thought of her, and, so
thinking, I all unconsciously slackened pace, and
dropped behind the others, letting my horse go
slower and slower until he barely walked. It was
at this moment that I became possessed of an intense
feeling that the thoughts of the woman I
loved were with me. I involuntarily glanced to
my right, and there, as I live, at the edge of the
purple shadow, where a lean glade opened and
stretched out, long and white, I saw her stand.
It was no dream of fancy. No fever of the brain.
She stood there, I say, at the fringe of the glade,
where the light and darkness joined, with the gold
of her hair all shining like a glory. She was looking
straight at me, with that in her glance I had
never seen before. It was not love nor hate, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>an infinite pity, that shone in her eyes, and then
her lips seemed to move in speech, and&mdash;she was
gone.</p>

<p>I drew rein at the spot where she stood. It
was not ten paces from me. I peered into the
quaking shadows, but my glance met nothing
except the endless lines of hoary trunks, that
stretched like pillars along the dim aisles of the
forest. Here and there, past the gaps in the
boughs that arched overhead, I saw the blood
light of the dying sunset shining as through the
stained glass of some old minster window, a
light that made the darkness yet more dark, and
flung strange, awesome shadows on the still
scene upon which it shone.</p>

<p>“Marie!” I called out in a low voice, “Marie!”</p>

<p>But there was no answer except the mockery of
the echoes. “Marie&mdash;Marie!” they gibed from behind
the haggard trees. “Marie&mdash;Marie!” they
whispered from the wan branches. The very air
was full of her name.</p>

<p>I turned, sick at heart, from those voices that
spoke to me of her.</p>

<p>Echoes&mdash;not they? They were the long-dead
people of the wood come back in that shivering
twilight&mdash;sprite and elf and goblin&mdash;and they had
fashioned of their cunning a phantom to make me
a plaything and a sport.</p>

<p>Slowly I pushed my horse a little way into the
wood, my eyes here, there, and everywhere. The
dry undergrowth snapped and crackled beneath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>his hoofs, and from a bent and twisted bough
overhead a huge owl, startled by the sound, fled
with flapping wings, and a dismal hoot, into the
deep of the forest.</p>

<p>I had totally forgotten my companions. In the
nervous state to which I was reduced, I know
not how far I might have gone on, but now I
heard my name called out again and again, as
Marcilly and Badehorn galloped back to seek me,
and, brought to the moment by their shouts, I
came out and joined them.</p>

<p>“<i>Cap de Diou!</i>” exclaimed Jean, “as our friend
Ponthieu would say, this is no season for woodland
flowers, Gaspard, nor are we here to gather
posies for our sweethearts. Have you a mind to
spend the night in Russy woods?”</p>

<p>A sharp answer rose to my tongue; but checking
myself I forced a laugh, and we rode on together,
until we at length reached the park gates
of Nanteuil, and found a hospitable welcome in
the house of Monsieur de Villequier.</p>

<p>There, as we sat round the log fire, sipping the
old Vouvray, and listening to Villequier’s tales&mdash;monsieur
was a veteran of Pavia and Cerisoles&mdash;we
all unconsciously threw off our gloom, and
Villequier seemed to slip back into the past years;
his cheeks flushed, and his eyes glowed as he recalled
his youth, and so the talk drifted on until
it struck midnight from the bells of the Antwerp
clock in the hall, and we retired to rest; and as I
lay down, all wearied, to sleep, I could not help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>thinking of the strong old age of our host, who
was descending as full of honors as of years to
his grave, and I wondered if the future would
bring me the same when I had played my part&mdash;wondered
and hoped.</p>

<p>That night I slept the sleep of the weary in
body and in mind, the sleep, deep and dreamless,
in which the hours pass like minutes, and it is
light and morning almost, as it seems, in a moment.
Strange as it may appear, no thought of
the vision I had seen troubled me, nor did it
appear again, and I woke with the sun, refreshed
and cooler in brain than I had been for long, and
laughed and jested gaily as we rode in the winter
sunlight, through the glistening woods on our
way to Orleans.</p>

<p>Marcilly, too, seemed to have shaken off his
sadness, or caught the infection of gayety from
me, and we gave way to the moment without a
thought that in a few hours we would be but a
finger’s distance from the rack, and the headsman’s
block.</p>

<p>I am not going to tell of how we rode through
the wintry Orléanais. How we swam the Cosson,
and galloped all wet and dripping to the Ardoux.
How we dried our clothes and broke our fast at
the Three Stags, opposite Our Lady of Clery,
where, in the chapel, those who care may see the
lonely grave of Louis XI. of France, that King
whose <i>tisane</i> was stronger than strong wine,
whose laughter was worse than his frown, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>who, small, deformed, and mean-looking as a
tailor of the Rue St. Antoine, could make his
proudest nobles shiver at a look.</p>

<p>All these things and more may rest, for they are
foreign to my story.</p>

<p>At length, splashed with the mud and snow of
the road, we passed the Loiret, and saw before us
the Faubourg St. Marceau, and beyond, on the
opposite bank of the Loire, the confused mass of
pointed gables and sloping roofs, square towers
and slender campaniles, that showed where Orleans
lay. Before us, on the left, rose high the
Abbey Church of Notre Dame de Recouvrance;
higher still, though looking smaller because of the
distance, stood the tall spire and the twin towers
of Ste. Croix; whilst overhead a mass of gray and
white clouds hung in the lazy air, and cast their
quivering shadows on the City of the Maid.</p>

<p>Our pulses quickened as we trotted through the
Rue Dauphine to the Quai des Augustins, and
Marcilly, as he passed the Tudette, pointed to the
spire of Notre Dame, standing out high to view,
and said:</p>

<p>“An omen of success! Our Lady of the Recouvrance
looks at us,” and he crossed himself, for he
was of the Popish faith. And I wondered in my
heart how man could turn to this saint and to
that, to relic and graven image, when the very
Godhead Himself seemed to hold His face from the
creatures He has made.</p>

<p>As we approached the Augustins, we could see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>that the city was garrisoned as if expecting a
siege. Everywhere there were guards of soldiery,
for the most part foreigners, and it was noticeable
that four out of five of the armed groups
bore the arms and wore the colors of the Guise.</p>

<p>“They seem Guisards to a man, Jean,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “and if we do not succeed
we shall have the eagle on our crown pieces.”</p>

<p>“There are two strings to our bow, however&mdash;Ponthieu
has got off safely with his letter.”</p>

<p>“True! But will Anne de Montmorenci move?
He has, it is said, a thousand lances at his back;
but the Guise can lay down three for every one of
his.”</p>

<p>“Then you put little faith in the Admiral’s
letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If the Constable could have moved he
would have done so before. He is not strong
enough, and it is well known that the first Christian
baron plays well for his own hand. He will
wait, and join the winning side&mdash;mark my words!”</p>

<p>As he said this we reached the quay, and while
Badehorn hailed a barge, Marcilly put on his
mask, and cocked his hat fiercely on one side of
his head, saying, with a laugh: “They know the
Prince too well in Orleans for me to appear
openly here.”</p>

<p>“But masked in full day!” I expostulated.</p>

<p>“I have a rash on my face,” he answered; “it
will vanish when we see Cipierre, to whom we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>must go at once. We should be with him in less
than an hour. He lives in the Place du Martroi.”</p>

<p>“And here is the barge,” I said, and, entering
it, we were taken slowly across the river.</p>

<p>“There is a large crowd there.” I pointed to the
opposite bank, where, on the Quai du Châtelet, a
good half of the population of Orleans seemed to
have assembled, all making in a westerly direction,
and swaying backward and forward, like
a wind-stirred field, while every now and again,
above the murmuring voices that hummed like a
thousand hives, a hoarse shout would be raised
that was taken up all along the line, to die again
as suddenly as it had sprung up.</p>

<p>“It is an expiation,” said our boatman, “a
Huguenot who refused to bow to Our Lady of
Mercy, in the Rue des Tanneurs, and he is to make
expiation there on the quay.”</p>

<p>“On the quay? That is strange!” I said. “Why
not before Ste. Croix, or in the Martroi?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is evidently a stranger,” replied our
Charon; “they do not expiate at Ste. Croix, and
the Martroi is kept now for the Prince. ’Tis said
he dies on the 10th.”</p>

<p>From out the blackness of his mask Marcilly
glanced at me, and our eyes met for an instant
as he asked:</p>

<p>“And is that known? We, who come from the
south, heard that he would not die.”</p>

<p>“All the world knows it,” replied our man;
“the barricades, and galleries for the spectators
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>are even now ready in the Martroi, as you will
see&mdash;but we talk of dangerous things, messieurs,
and we have reached the quay. Ah! Thanks!
This will buy a brave petticoat for my little
Lardille.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CITY OF THE MAID</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> four steps we were on the white, glistening
quay, and, mounting our horses, began to edge
toward the nearest gate, the Porte Royale, by
which we proposed to enter the city. It was a
task that was far from easy, unless we wished to
ride over the heads of the people, for the small
space was more than crowded, and one and all
were pushing, struggling, and hurrying to be on
the scene of the execution in time.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Marcilly, standing in his stirrups,
and from the height of his horse looking over the
heads of the people, “it is awful&mdash;he dies by the
Estrapade.”</p>

<p>I followed his glance, and, gazing toward the
little enclosure in front of the Rue des Tanneurs,
saw the post and chains, and the stack of wood
that was to form the pyre.</p>

<p>“The patient has not arrived as yet; but the
galleries are full.”</p>

<p>“Yes, one can see the dresses of the ladies flashing
like a bank of flowers. Hear the crowd
bark!”</p>

<p>And as he spoke there was a rush to the palisades,
and groans, hoots, cat-calls, and a tempest
of mob-cries arose as the people were driven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>back, and beaten into order by the men-at-arms,
while through the shouts, the cries, the oaths
and the screams, one heard ever and again the
guttural voice of the reiter, or the snake-like,
hissing curse of the Italian free-lance, as, with the
butts of their lances, and the heels of their horses,
they bore the crowd now this way and now
that, and threw something of their own perfect
discipline into the chaotic mass.</p>

<p>And as I looked I felt a thrill of horror at the
thought of what the unfortunate condemned was
to endure ere death would end his agony. The
Estrapade&mdash;it was the lifting in and out of a slow
fire&mdash;and death took long to come with this. And
all this pain! All this suffering! Because, forsooth,
the wretched man had not bowed to the
graven image of the Virgin and her Child! Truly,
a fit sacrifice to One who sent His Son with the
message of love and forgiveness to earth!</p>

<p>I thank God I never saw him. He was led to
his death by the Quatre Fils, and, poor cobbler
though he was, he ended his life like a hero and
a saint. But six years later he was avenged, on
that day when the gutters of Orleans ran in red
puddles, and Lanoy pulled down the towers of
Ste. Croix in memory of Étienne Caillaud. That,
too, I never saw, for it was six years after my
living death.</p>

<p>“Onward!” said Marcilly, “else we shall be unable
to move. Ah! See the cubs of Guise!”</p>

<p>And he pointed with his hand to a small group
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>of riders, for whom the crowd made way with the
readiness born of fear. In the midst of these were
three boys, also mounted, and one, the eldest,
was tall, a head taller than his brothers, and,
child though he was, bore on his features all the
pride of Lorraine. His brothers were laughing as
they spoke to each other, but he rode in silence, a
trifle in advance, now and then coldly lifting his
hand in answer to some salute with the grave
courtesy of a little king.</p>

<p>“’Tis the young Joinville and his brothers,”
Marcilly ran on; “child as he is, he thinks himself
Dauphin already.”</p>

<p>“As he may be some day.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” called out a woman near us, who bore a
child in one arm, while another of eight or ten
years clung to her girdle. “Ah! See the young
Princes, Henriquet! It will not be long now; let
us hasten.”</p>

<p>“One takes long to die by the Estrapade; there
will be time,” said the man whom she had addressed,
a sober-looking person, evidently of the
artisan class, who for one did not seem to enjoy
the prospect of witnessing what was to happen.</p>

<p>“And why not, Maître Echelle? Why not? Has
he not sinned against the Holy Ghost, and our
Lord the Pope? Ah! He is a wicked man. I
hope he will take long to die.”</p>

<p>“Have a care, woman!” said Marcilly, whose
horse was near her; “have a care of the horse,
and learn to be a little more pitiful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>The woman looked up, and, seeing the black
mask and the grim, mud-bespattered figure of
Marcilly, shrank back as she muttered, “It is an
assassin, an assassin for sure, who goes masked
even in plain day.”</p>

<p>“Way then,” I cut in impatiently, and pressing
forward, we drove the crowd before us, but
ere we had gone ten yards the shrew had recovered
her courage and railed after us with her
scolding tongue.</p>

<p>“Ho! They are traitors, heretics, those three
who ride there! See the masked one with the
devil’s face. Traitors! Heretics! To the fire with
them!”</p>

<p>In a moment the crowd gathered round us with
menacing faces, and from threats it was clear
they would soon come to blows. We were forced
to draw our swords, and meant to sell our lives
dearly if it came to the push, but the sight of
the steel cooled the ardor of the mob a little,
and they recoiled, only, however, to come on
again with renewed boldness. It was our last
wish to have anything even approaching a scuffle
now, but we were dealing with people gone
mad with excitement, and it was hard to say
what would happen at any moment.</p>

<p>“Name of the devil!” roared Badehorn to a
group of a half-dozen or so of Light Horse, in
the black and yellow of Guise, “keep off these
dogs, else there will be bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“That is your affair,” answered their leader,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>an Italian, in his lisping French. “We are not
police.”</p>

<p>“You will answer for this, though,” said I hotly,
as I made my horse curvet and kick, for the crowd
began to rush in again.</p>

<p>They laughed loudly in reply, and, emboldened
by this, there was another rush, and Badehorn
was almost pulled from his saddle. Inch by inch,
however, we made our way somehow, taking
advantage of every foot of space that was given,
and clearing the path by sweeping the flats of
our swords to the right and left. But this could
not go on for long, and we were scarce a hand’s
breadth from the most deadly peril when, in a
momentary pause, I called out:</p>

<p>“Fools! Are you mad that you listen to an
angry woman and try to hinder us who ride for
Her Majesty the Queen-Mother! Way! Way!
Else beware the <i>carcan</i> and the lash!”</p>

<p>The boldness with which I said this had some
effect; the crowd hesitated a little, yet still we
were not safe, and they were preparing to launch
themselves on us again when a low murmur
caught our ears, and arrested those about us,
a murmur that increased in volume and intensity
until it became a deep, hoarse roar.</p>

<p>“The patient! The patient! He comes!”</p>

<p>In one moment we were utterly forgotten. In
one moment we were safe. In the absorbing interest
before them the mob let us drop as an ape
drops an empty nutshell, and pressed forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>with mad strugglings and fierce yells toward
the scaffoldings. Far within the choking, gasping
mass some one began to sing that terrible
death song, which has rung in the ears of so
many martyrs of the faith:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Au feu! Au feu! C’est leur repère.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Faites en justice! Dieu l’a permis</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the crowd caught the verse and gave it back,
so that shout and scream died away; but in their
room swelled the pitiless chorus, as the multitude
marched to the lilt of the tune, forming in
line, as it were, of their own accord, and beating
time to the measure with their feet as they
rolled along the long quay in an endless column.</p>

<p>Men, women, and children in that vast assemblage
had all gone mad. They marched arm-in-arm,
singing their dolorous hymn, some with
white faces, others with bloodshot cheeks; but
one and all with eager eyes straining before them,
and one and all drunk with the wild music of
their chant.</p>

<p>In the distance I saw our artisan, he whom I
thought had something of pity in his heart; but
he, too, had caught the nameless infection, and
with head thrown back and staring eyes was
singing with the rest, while at his side marched
his wife, and her shrill, hard voice rose piercing
and high:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">“<i>Au feu! Au feu! C’est leur repère!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“<i>C’est leur repère!</i>” bellowed the echoing mob,
as it swung past us to see a martyr die.</p>

<p>We waited to see no more. Our hearts were
already sick enough, and, seizing the opportunity
given to us, passed through the gates, and took
our way to the house of Cipierre, over the uneven
and still slippery cobble-stones of the ill-paved
Rue Royale.</p>

<p>“If I live a hundred years, I shall never forget
to-day,” said Marcilly, as we rode together side
by side.</p>

<p>“And yet we have actually seen nothing. Still,
I agree with you. I have never felt the horror
that I felt to-day.”</p>

<p>“It is, I think, what we have not seen which
affects us.”</p>

<p>And then perhaps the same thought came to
us both, and we lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>For the moment we might have been riding
through a city of the dead. Here in the Rue
Royale there was not a soul to be seen. All
the shops were shut, every door was barred, and
the stones of the pavement echoed dismally to the
hoofs of our horses. On either side of the narrow
street the gutters, full of melted snow and
mud, bubbled angrily past, and here and there,
where the mouth of some blind alley, or cut-throat
lane, opened out and yawned at us, the wind
came bustling through, blowing damp and chill
as the cavernous deeps from which it came. On
each hand, the houses, old as the days of La
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>Pucelle, raised their walls, leprous with mottlings
of purple, gray, brown, and white, in story after
story above us, so that but a thin slit of sky
was alone visible between the pentice roofs, that
seemed to totter toward each other; while from
out of the dappled surface of the walls, round
projecting windows and crenellated balconies
thrust themselves, forming a shelter over the uneven
footways that clung to the edges of the
road.</p>

<p>Now and again we caught a glimpse of the
stray figure of a woman or a child, standing at
a window or leaning out of a balcony, and looking
at us with an eager curiosity, and once one
called down to us:</p>

<p>“Is it over? Did he suffer much? Did he speak?”</p>

<p>To all these questions, which were asked in a
breath, Badehorn replied for us with an expressive
shake of his head, and as he did so we reached
the Rue Jeanne d’Arc, which broke in here upon
the Rue Royale, and, making a half turn to the
right, as we reined in to observe the view for a
moment, we found ourselves facing Ste. Croix.
A little to our left, above the confused mass of
red and gray roofs, rose the wings of the royal
palace, now dark with the shadow of a passing
cloud, while beyond, above the battlements
of the main tower, and half in shadow and half
in light, fluttered the royal standard of France,
and now and again through the bays of the
windows, or past the embrasures, we caught the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>gleam of a pike or the flash of a lance. To our
right, frowning over the Capuchin Convent, we
could see the grim mass of the Hôtel de Ville,
and before us, as I have said, at the end of a
broad, straight road, stood the huge façade of
Ste. Croix, all glistening in the sunlight, as if
the very clouds would not shadow that great
temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>Even as we stood there the chime of the vesper
bells began, but above their mellow note the
freshening breeze blowing from the west bore us
a faint cadence from afar; the mob was singing
yet around the dying victim of bigotry and superstition.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon dieu!</i>” I burst out, “that devil’s hymn
will follow us forever”; and we waited no more,
but turned again and trotted over the few yards
that separated us from the Place du Martroi.</p>

<p>Here there were still a few people gathered
around a scaffold that had been erected in the
centre of the square. Around this scaffold was
a palisade, and beyond the palisade men were
busily at work giving the finishing touches to
the wooden galleries that would overlook the
coming scene. As we came into the square the
block was being placed on the platform, and a
short, broadly built man, dressed in black, with
a black mask on his face, was superintending the
operation.</p>

<p>Marcilly and I exchanged glances, but Badehorn
for once began to speak:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, messieurs! It is Monsieur of Paris himself.
I saw him last when the Comte de Ste. Marie
died at Amboise.”</p>

<p>“It appears, then, that Monsieur of Paris has
an assistant as well,” said a voice which appeared
to spring from the ground, as it broke
in upon Badehorn’s speech. Looking to my
side with a start, I saw a small man dressed in
a suit of orange and green satin. A short cloak
of the same gay colours hung from his shoulders,
while his sceptre, crowned with the head of an
ass in gold, and his cap and bells showed his
calling.</p>

<p>He was staring at Marcilly with his little eyes
that flashed and twinkled, from a face as long
and sharp as that of a polecat, while his lips,
parted in a smile, showed two rows of strong
white teeth. He had apparently come out from
behind the boardings of one of the galleries, and
now stood right in our path, swinging his sceptre
backward and forward, with his eyes fixed
on Marcilly’s mask. His meaning was obvious,
and Jean angrily raised his whip; but the jester
skipped back nimbly, and vanished behind the
shelter of his boardings with an elfish laugh.</p>

<p>“That mask is like to bring you more trouble
than profit,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“It has served its purpose, however,” said he
as he slipped it off and thrust it under the flap
of his holster. “Think you, what would have
happened if the crowd had raised a shout of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>‘Condé!’ in that mood. It was better, after all,
to risk the gibes of that jester&mdash;confound him&mdash;I
wonder whose he was?”</p>

<p>“It matters not. Perhaps he belongs to the
Court; but surely you do not mean to continue
to wear the mask while you are in Orleans?”</p>

<p>“Not after we are under the wing of the Queen-Mother;
but here is Cipierre’s house at last.”</p>

<p>As he said this we reined up before the gates
of a house, at the corner of a square, overlooking
the Rue de la Hallebarde. The house itself
stood a little way back from the square, from
which it was separated by a courtyard, bounded
by a high, spiked wall, in the centre of which
was a huge iron-studded gate, flanked on each
side by two squat towers with a gallery between,
on the face of which, and immediately
above the door, was the blazon of Cipierre.</p>

<p>The gate was shut, but opened at once to our
knock, discovering the flagged court, the wide
stairway that led to the house door, and the figures
of one or two armed men lounging in the
enclosure.</p>

<p>The porter, an old man, bent and white-headed,
recognized Marcilly at once.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Comte!” he exclaimed, astonishment
and delight lighting his dim eyes, for he
had known Jean since he was a child.</p>

<p>“Yes, I in flesh and blood, Bobeche! And is
the Vicomte in?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte has gone to the expiation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and sups after with Monsieur de Sancerre.”</p>

<p>“I might have expected something like this,”
muttered Marcilly to himself, then, raising his
voice, “Monsieur de Vibrac and I will wait, Bobeche.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, monsieur. The house is yours, as
you know. Ah! But the return of monsieur will
gladden madame’s eyes. She was here but yesterday.
But messieurs are travel-stained and
weary, and that <i>coquin</i> of a steward and every
soul in the place has gone sight-seeing, except
Jacques, monsieur’s valet, who is as old as myself
and these three Switzers. Jacques, <i>mon ami</i>,
here are monsieur le comte and his friend, who
have travelled far. Attend then quickly to the
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” I said. “Had you not better
send to warn Cipierre of our arrival?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I woolgather. Of course!” and taking
out a pocket-book, and tearing a leaf therefrom,
Jean scribbled a few lines, and, folding it carefully,
handed it to one of the Swiss.</p>

<p>“For monsieur le vicomte,” I said, in his tongue,
for I had served in the Trans-Alpine Infantry.
“It is urgent, and here is a crown to quicken
your footsteps.”</p>

<p>The man saluted, pocketed the money, and
withdrew. We then consigned ourselves to the
hospitable care of Jacques, and an hour later
Jean and myself met in the great hall, refreshed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>by our bath and change of toilet, and looking
like different men. Jacques offered us wine, but,
though we sipped a little, we were both of us
beginning to feel that we had come to the edge
of the precipice, and put down our cups practically
full.</p>

<p>“Madame de Marcilly was here yesterday, I understand?”
said Marcilly to Jacques.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, with Mademoiselle de Beauce.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! That will do,” and then Jean walked
to the window and stared out across the square
in the direction of the palace, while I stood at
the fireplace, my foot on a dog’s head of the
fender, and our hearts were both with the same
woman.</p>

<p>He came back to me at last, and flung himself
in a chair, still looking before him with a gray
sadness in his eyes, as he said low to himself:</p>

<p>“Poor Marie!”</p>

<p>In my confidence I felt I was victor over myself;
but the words rasped me somehow, and I
moved impatiently from my position.</p>

<p>“You are getting the blues, Jean. ’Tis this city
of horrors into which we have come. Rouse
yourself, man! We are on the threshold now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, on the threshold&mdash;of what?” he asked,
but still as if speaking to himself. “We are on
the threshold, and the door will open soon&mdash;but
where will it lead? We are giving our lands, our
wealth, our lives, all that we hold dear, for a
dream&mdash;and life is dear to me, Gaspard, not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>much for its own sake, but for the sake of her
who loves me.”</p>

<p>“We should have thought of that before, and
there is still time to draw back.” There was a
bitterness in my tone I could not conceal, and a
faint flush reddened his cheeks.</p>

<p>“You are right to spur me,” he said, as he
drained his cup and rose to his feet, “and here
comes our messenger.”</p>

<p>The Switzer came in with his heavy stride, and,
saluting, stood dumbly before us.</p>

<p>“You have given the letter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Excellency.”</p>

<p>“And the answer&mdash;any?”</p>

<p>The man drew from his pocket a tablet, and
handed it to me. I passed it on to Jean, who
attempted to read it, but in vain.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i> He may have written this with the
point of his dagger. Can you make it out?”</p>

<p>We did, with some difficulty, and the words of
the note, written in a huge, sprawling hand, ran
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Welcome. Sancerre bids me say he expects you and de
Vibrac to join us at supper at seven. Come.</p>

<p class="right">CIPIERRE.</p></div>

<p>“The door is opening,” I said, with a forced
gayety; “we must go.”</p>

<p>“And it wants but a half-hour,” answered Jean,
as he pointed to the clock.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> the last trembling notes of the vesper bells
died away, the gates of Cipierre’s house
opened, and Marcilly and myself, accompanied by
one of the Swiss, rode out into the square. We
had judged it wise to take a man in Cipierre’s
colors with us, as, in case of any accident, the
fact of our being accompanied by one of the
guards of the governor of Orleans might prove
of advantage. Marcilly had resumed his mask.
This now would not attract the attention it had
done in full day, for it was a common enough
custom to wear such a thing after sunset, as a
protection against the inclemency of the night
air.</p>

<p>“Are Cipierre and Sancerre to be let into our
confidence?” I said in Spanish, to avoid any
chance of the Swiss understanding our converse.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of that a good deal,”
Marcilly replied, “and it will all depend upon how
far they are willing to go. Sancerre is ready
enough to move, I believe&mdash;Maligny was strong in
insisting on that. As for Cipierre, he may think
himself bound by his office, as Captain of Orleans,
not to do anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“In that case we are leaning on a very doubtful
support if we trust to Cipierre to get us access to
the palace to-night.”</p>

<p>“Not so. He will do that much. He hates the
Guise, and, rough soldier as he is, he loves me
well. There may be a little difficulty, and I may
have to use some of the diplomacy I learned in
the Spanish Embassy; but we will get our interview
with Catherine. Once arouse their enthusiasm,
and they will be with us for good and all.
Courage! We have little to fear on that score.”</p>

<p>We were in the Hallebarde at the time of this
conversation, and the contrast, between the state
of the streets on our entry into the town and
now, was marked. The expiation was over, and
the Loire was carrying down its sluggish current
the ashes of the unfortunate victim of a ferocious
bigotry. Orleans had returned to its hive, but
still the excitement of the awful scene had not
passed. The Hallebarde was full, and the shops
had reopened, even for the short time that lay
between this and the hour, nine o’clock, by which,
under the edict, all lights were to be extinguished.</p>

<p>The street itself was dim, lit only by stray
lanterns, hanging at long intervals, on ropes that
ran across from house to house, but the pavement
was awake to the tramp of passing feet,
and men and women flitted before us like gray
shadows, or stood out in bold silhouette against
the lights from the doors of a cabaret, or the
windows of a shop, or maybe dwelling-house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>Every now and again a group of lackeys, with
drawn swords and lighted torches, would pass us,
escorting the litter of some court lady or priest of
rank, and almost at every hundred paces we met
a party of mounted men, who went by us with a
clattering of arms, and a flashing of steel, while
above the insistent hum of voices we often caught
a word or phrase, that told us what was the one
subject of conversation. They were full of what
had happened, and of what was to be.</p>

<p>It was, however, in the Rue du Tabourg that a
thing occurred that seemed to be an omen of success.
We were at the spot where the Cheval
Rouge crosses the Tabourg, and were for a moment
arrested by a crowd gathered around the
entrance to an ordinary, and extending from the
door itself almost across the street. As we came
up we heard a voice cry out loudly: “Imbeciles!
Wait till the 10th. The expiation of our Caillaud
will be nothing to that. We will see something
on the 10th.” And the speaker, a tall, thin man,
with projecting teeth and a wrinkled face, stood
in the full glare of the light, swinging his arms
over his head.</p>

<p>“And what will we see?” questioned a voice
from the crowd.</p>

<p>The tall man looked around him, and into the
darkness. He was about to say something, but
the people answered for him:</p>

<p>“The Prince! The Prince dies on the 10th!”</p>

<p>“The Prince will not die,” answered the voice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>and this time I saw as well as heard the speaker.
He was on my left, in the shadow of the wall,
between my horse and the door of the cabaret,
and he was the jester of the Place de Martroi.</p>

<p>“How? Why?” exclaimed a dozen voices; but
with his odd laugh the jester slipped back, and
mingled with the shadow. He seemed, so suddenly
did he vanish from my sight, to have melted
into air.</p>

<p>We pushed through the crowd, who were asking
each other eager questions, as to who had answered
the tall man in so strange a manner, and
as we got clear of them Marcilly remarked:</p>

<p>“The laugh I heard reminded me much of the
jester we met in the Martroi.”</p>

<p>“It was he,” I answered; “I saw him distinctly.
He was close to my nag’s head. You heard what
he said?”</p>

<p>“That the Prince would not die on the
10th.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“What can I think? If the fool belongs to the
Court, he may have heard some gossip, and took
the opportunity to repeat what he knew. If, on
the other hand, it is one of those vain winds that
whistle through the head of folly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Excellencies, we stop here,” said the Swiss;
“this is the Comte de Sancerre’s house.”</p>

<p>We rode into the courtyard, and dismounting,
gave our horses to the lackeys who came to meet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>us. As we ascended the stairway Marcilly remarked:</p>

<p>“This is the house that Agnes Sorel lived in.
It came to Sancerre with his wife, and old de
Beuil has lived here since her death. Though of
the first nobility, and a faithful servant of the
King, he is now never seen in Paris. He went
out as the Guise came in.”</p>

<p>“I confess I am curious to meet him&mdash;the one
peer of France, the one knight of the King’s Order,
who refused in full Council to sign the death-warrant
of the Prince.”</p>

<p>“Hum! I don’t know that the King’s Order is
much of an honor now, though you and I both
hold it. They have given it to every Italian
bravo, or sneaking Lorrainer that can boast
of having a grandfather&mdash;truly, Tiercelin said
well when he called it the Collar of all the
Beasts.”</p>

<p>As he spoke we were shown into a small room,
where, close to the fireplace, covers were laid for
four. There was no one in the room when we
entered, and while Marcilly sank wearily on to
a seat, I leaned against the window, now watching
the gray night outside, and the dim twinkling
of the lamps in the city, then turning my
eyes in idle curiosity, on the quaint tapestry and
old arms with which the walls were hung.</p>

<p>We had not, however, to wait above a few
minutes. Then we heard voices in eager converse,
the door opened, and Sancerre and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>Captain of Orleans entered with a warm welcome
and excuses for keeping us waiting. Louis
de Beuil, Comte de Sancerre, was at that time
nearly seventy years of age. In person he was
tall and thin, with a pale face, bright blue eyes,
and a white beard that fell half-way down his
chest. He was dressed in black, and walked with
a slight stoop. Cipierre, on the other hand,
though he counted as many years as Sancerre,
was in marked contrast to him. I can picture
him now standing before me, a gray old wolf,
with his square jaw, short, bristling moustache,
and closely cut beard.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac,” said Sancerre, as he
shook me by the hand, “believe me, I welcome
you here; but you come to a city which ought
to be in sackcloth.”</p>

<p>Cipierre tugged at his moustache, and glanced
from Marcilly to me, as he cut in, with a short
laugh:</p>

<p>“Ste. Croix! If I did my duty, nephew, both
you and monsieur here ought to be on your way
to the Hôtel de Ville. What grasshopper did you
get into your head, to put yourself into the lion’s
jaws as you have?”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I began to feel a trifle uncomfortable
at this sudden change of manner in the
vicomte, but Jean replied calmly:</p>

<p>“How, monsieur? You would send us to the
Hôtel de Ville, who come to offer our swords to
the King? Believe me, they will be more useful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>than our heads sticking on the spikes of the Porte
Royale.”</p>

<p>Cipierre laughed once more. “Let me tell you,
you would be safer in the Hôtel de Ville than out
of it.”</p>

<p>“With Monsieur Sarlaboux to guard us! My
uncle, you are too kind! I little thought that
Cipierre would ever serve the Guise.”</p>

<p>The shot told, and the brown cheek of the old
soldier became brick red.</p>

<p>“<i>Mordieu!</i> I serve the Guise! Since when? If
the King, or even Madame Catherine, would but
lift a finger, I&mdash;yes I, <i>mordieu!</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Sancerre interrupted him, and, placing his
hand on Cipierre’s shoulder, said with his quiet
voice:</p>

<p>“Steady, old friend! Even our heads are shaking.
Be careful lest they fall! Come, messieurs!
Let us to supper. The blood runs cold at my age,
and I need something to warm it. And you, too,
gentlemen, I doubt not, are famished.”</p>

<p>For some little time the conversation confined
itself to the event of the day, but when at last
we were alone with the wine, Sancerre said, with
a look at Cipierre:</p>

<p>“Messieurs, we are alone now, and these walls
are deaf, so we can speak freely. Let me tell you
that the air of Orleans is unhealthy at present.
Take my advice and go with the dawn.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, we came, as I said, to offer our
swords to the King.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“The King,” said Cipierre, “will soon need no
earthly sword to protect him. He is dying.”</p>

<p>“Dying! Is it as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur de Vibrac. It is a matter of
days only, I fear, and after that&mdash;well, I am an
old man, and I have served them for fifty years;
but with his death it is an end to the Valois.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, how can that be? There are the
other Princes.”</p>

<p>“Leaves drop from a dead tree, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“And to compare it with other things, I have
known an eagle take a lamb before.”</p>

<p>It was Marcilly who spoke, and, at this reference
to the crest of Guise, Cipierre swore under
his moustache; and I went on with the talk, saying:</p>

<p>“It appears to me that the eagle must reckon
with Bourbon.”</p>

<p>“The account is almost made up,” said Sancerre;
“the ambition of Catherine and the folly
of the Constable have played well into the hands
of Guise. The Bourbon is a dead legend, unless
a miracle were to happen. Navarre is a fool and
a sot. Montpensier has been bought with the
pears of Touraine, and La Roche-sur-Yonne with
the quinces of the Orléanais. There remains only
Condé, and his head falls on the 10th. After that,
Cipierre, you and I, and all of us, must bend the
knee to King Francis the Third.”</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Cipierre; “never!” and he
struck his open palm on the table. “Why! I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Claude of Lorraine a mere gentleman of
the Court&mdash;and his son King! Never!”</p>

<p>“Why should not the miracle happen?” It was
Jean who spoke, and our eyes met. His face had
paled a little, and the hand which held his goblet
shook, but the moment had come. I saw he was
about to risk a hazard and waited, unquiet and
troubled.</p>

<p>“I do not follow you,” said Sancerre, whilst
Cipierre turned a questioning eye on his nephew.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” he began, “I and my friends have
come here and placed our lives in your hands,
not in idle recklessness, but because we have a
great work to do. I have said, placed our lives
in your hands, but from you I know we are safe;
and we know, too&mdash;all France knows&mdash;that the
King has no servants more loyal than de Beuil
of Sancerre, and the head of my house. Is it not
as I say?”</p>

<p>Neither made reply. Cipierre kept pulling at his
moustache, and Sancerre’s white forehead wrinkled
slightly; but his keen blue eyes said “Go on,” and
Jean continued:</p>

<p>“We have just seen that between the Guise and
the throne there is but one life to be reckoned
with. How it has come to that, you know as
well as I do. We have, in short, just discussed
it, and it is needless to go over the same ground
again. Now, gentlemen, are we to sit still and
see Louis of Bourbon die?”</p>

<p>“It is the King’s order,” said Cipierre, drily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“And that sentence has been confirmed by the
Estates of France, to their eternal disgrace,”
added Sancerre.</p>

<p>“I had thought that five thousand swords
would have flashed from their scabbards ere a
prince of the blood died at the nod of Guise.”</p>

<p>“The flashing is over, monsieur, and the gutters
of Amboise still run red. The Guise have
won the game, curse them!” said Cipierre.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, there are still a few cards
for us,” replied Marcilly. He had risen from his
chair and was standing at the table now, the
light full on his resolute features.</p>

<p>“My lords!” he went on solemnly, “we all know
the issue at stake. We all know, too, that there
are times when one or two devoted men have
done what was thought to be impossible. Vibrac
and I have come to attempt this, and we ask your
help. I see before me one in whose veins runs the
blood royal of France. I see before me a soldier
of the days of Pavia and Cerisoles, the head of
my house, whose battle cry is ‘For my Honor
and my King!’ Do I appeal to them in vain?”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Cipierre. “Are we to
open the windows and call out ‘A Condé?! A
Condé!’ Think you that the town will rise?
Guise is Lieutenant-General of the kingdom. He
has two thousand lances at his back. He holds
the King and Madame Catherine in the hollow
of his hand. No, the wine is drawn, messieurs,
and there is nothing left but the drinking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Then, my lords, you appear to think that we
must stand still and look on while Guise makes
his last stroke! That we, Frenchmen, should sit
in our balconies, while the Lorrainers keep our
streets! You risk nothing by joining us. In any
case, if Guise wins, it is ruin, if not death to us
all. Let me tell you one thing more. It is possible
that the Constable may move at once, and the
Admiral is already raising Poitou; yet again,
Catherine is now with us, and another still&mdash;the
Queen herself.”</p>

<p>“Mary of Scotland&mdash;the niece of Guise!” exclaimed
Cipierre, while Sancerre smiled quietly,
as he said: “You are well informed, Marcilly.”</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Marcilly, taking no note
of the interruptions, “that we still have some
cards, and if we can save the Prince, the Guise
lose their game totally. Vibrac and I are here
to do that, and, my lords, we seek but your aid
to see the Queen-Mother and the King to-night,
for there is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>He resumed his seat, and for the moment there
was a silence. Cipierre toyed with his glass, and
Sancerre leaned back, stroking his beard. All at
once he rose, with a smile on his face, and, turning
toward the vicomte, said:</p>

<p>“Cipierre, old friend, will I tell you what we
are going to do? We now go to take these two
gentlemen to the palace. We now go to bear two
good swords to the King. We now go to awake
my friend. We have been asleep. We would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>traitors to our blood and our honor if we refused
our help, and if the worst comes to the
worst, we are both old enough to have learned
how to die. Gentlemen, I am with you,” and he
turned to us. “Give me your hands.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mordieu!</i>” burst out Cipierre, “and mine too.
Come what may!”</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW SIGNOR BENTIVOGLIO BURNED HIS ALOES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arcilly</span> was right when he said that if we
once succeeded in enlisting the good wishes
of Sancerre and his uncle, they would act for us
with full hearts. He knew them better than I did,
who had forebodings as to the result of his plan;
but through the information he had received from
Maligny, and, above all, from Marie, he was enabled
to gauge the situation correctly, and he had
brought home the fact that both Cipierre and
Sancerre were doomed men in the case of the
death of Condé. Events had so worked at that
time, that this would leave the Guise without a
rival in France, and they would certainly not
hesitate to take their toll of vengeance from the
vicomte, whose hatred to their house was known;
and still less would they stay their hands against
Sancerre, whose flat refusal to aid in the sham
trial had so nearly scattered all the fine-spun
schemes of Lorraine.</p>

<p>While we were buckling on our swords, and
awaiting the horses, Cipierre bluntly asked his
nephew:</p>

<p>“And what is your plan, Marcilly? You have
not told us that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Jean was about to answer, when Sancerre cut
in with a laugh.</p>

<p>“<i>Tudieu!</i> My dear vicomte, it is not necessary
for us to know as yet. Our business is to smooth
the way for these gentlemen at the palace, and
to see that a stout horse or two is ready if
wanted.”</p>

<p>“But to work in the dark&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly! We will take a lesson from the mole,
and work in the dark for the present. The light
will come to us later on. Now, we do not need
it. And more, it has gone compline, and we
must hasten. Here are the horses! Come, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>Cipierre shrugged his shoulders, and finished
his wine as the old count fastened the clasp of
his cloak and led the way down-stairs, where
we found the horses ready, and the light from
the torches shining in scales of fire on the cuirasses
of the governor’s guard.</p>

<p>“To the palace,” said Cipierre, “by the Bourgogne!”</p>

<p>And filing out of the narrow gate, a few steps
brought us to the Rue Royale, across which we
found the Bourgogne.</p>

<p>Sancerre rode between Marcilly and myself,
Cipierre a little ahead, sitting squarely on his
Picard horse, and grimly silent.</p>

<p>“One great difficulty we have to deal with,”
said Marcilly, “is the coming of the Princess to
Orleans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> You do not mean to say she is
coming? Why, it is worse than folly!”</p>

<p>“It is madness,” replied Jean.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sancerre; “the madness of a woman
who loves. Ah! If we had but a little time.”</p>

<p>What answer Marcilly would have made I know
not; but now we came to the turning to the left,
which led into the Rue Parisis, and Cipierre, suddenly
reining back, pointed to a house, which
raised its solidly built wall high over the others
in the little square, saying in a low voice:</p>

<p>“There!”</p>

<p>Nothing more was wanted to tell us we were
before Condé’s prison. Not a ray of light gleamed
from the sullen walls, which looked down upon
us with a chill blankness. The upper half of the
building was in gray darkness, but there was an
orange glow on the lower half, that reached to
the crenellated balcony, caused by a huge fire that
burned in the courtyard; and by the glare of this
we saw four pieces of artillery grinning over the
towers of the gate.</p>

<p>“You should know those, Jean,” Cipierre went
on; “they are the Emperor’s Pistols.”</p>

<p>Marcilly laughed a little bitterly. “They are
doing now for Guise what they never did for the
Emperor,” he answered, as we rode on, crossing
the Grands Ciseaux, over the broad, flat stones
of the parvis of Ste. Croix, which stood a huge,
shadowy phantom to our right, and halted at
last before the palace gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>As we walked across the flagged courtyard my
sleep of thought awoke once more within me. I
forgot in a moment our perilous enterprise. All
that was present in my mind was that I was
near Marie, that I would see her once again
whom I loved.</p>

<p>No chain of lightning links itself so quickly together
as one’s thoughts. In a flash I reviewed
the whole matter again, and bargained with myself.
I would see her, perhaps speak to her; but
it would be for the last time, and I would carry
that dear memory away with me to the distant
land I meant to seek if I escaped the dangers before
me.</p>

<p>I caught myself actually peering into the knots
of the archers of the Scots Guards to see if she
was there, and then laughed at my folly, only to
look again at the next group I saw with the
same expectancy. Every figure, every voice, every
shadow in the long galleries, or behind the glazing
of the windows, seemed to take her shape
and form.</p>

<p>There are those who may read these lines and
smile at the fool and his folly. They are fortunate
in not having passed through what I did.
Let them examine their own hearts, however,
and smile, if they can yet smile, then. Those
hearts may be harder, more steeled than mine,
but, I swear, that in their silent prisons lie secrets
that should still the jeer and silence the gibe.</p>

<p>For me, I am hiding nothing, concealing nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
It is part of my punishment to lay bare
the working of those influences which led me,
one by one, to be what I am&mdash;a man of regrets.</p>

<p>Strange! With every thought of the woman I
loved there began to stir again within me that
bitterness toward Marcilly I have spoken of before.
It was the bitterness one feels toward the
man whom one has wronged. In the wave of
good impulse that had swept over me, I thought
this evil fire had been extinguished; but here it
was again, burning slowly and surely. And yet
I was his brother, sworn to stand by him to the
end. There were times when I felt strong, when
my very heart was with him; but when these
memories cropped up, I had to force myself to
the right, drag myself like an unwilling dog at
the end of a chain.</p>

<p>It was with these mingled feelings in my heart,
that I walked up the gallery that led to Catherine’s
apartments. Cipierre was by my side, and
a yard or so before us were Marcilly and Sancerre,
conversing in low, rapid tones. Sancerre
was getting that confidence he had prevented
Cipierre from obtaining ere we started.</p>

<p>The corridor was in semi-darkness, being lit by
cressets placed at some distance apart, which
threw a feeble light around them, casting grotesque
shadows on the polished oak of the floor,
and the heavy tapestry that clung to the walls.</p>

<p>At the extreme end, opposite to us, the light
was brighter; and facing us, at the side of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>door, young Lorgnac, the lieutenant of the Queen’s
Guard, was seated on a coffer, his drawn sword
resting between his knees.</p>

<p>When we were half-way up the corridor, the
door near which Lorgnac was seated opened, and
a man stepped out, closing it quickly behind
him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant half rose, but the stranger stayed
him with a laugh and a wave of his hand. Then,
with a hurried word in Lorgnac’s ear, he turned
and came toward us with quick, firm steps. He
was splashed with mud, his corselet was seamed
and scarred with lines of fresh rust, and the long
red plume in his hat hung limply down. He
looked as one who had ridden far and hard, and
he came toward us with an indescribable swagger,
his sword in the loop of his arm, and clinking
the rowels of his huge spurs.</p>

<p>“’Tis Richelieu!” said Sancerre; and Marcilly,
who had stepped back to my side on seeing him,
pressed my arm as he whispered:</p>

<p>“My friend of the forest of Châtillon.”</p>

<p>We thought he would have come right up to
us, and Jean stepped as far into the shadow as
possible, but we were mistaken. Whistling low
to himself, Richelieu stopped before a side door.
It opened to his touch, and with a quick glance
at us he was gone.</p>

<p>“So ‘The Monk’ is back,” said Sancerre, using
the nickname by which this formidable soldier
was known, for he had once held orders. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>Carabiniers have been without their captain for
a week.”</p>

<p>“Some Devil’s errand,” grumbled Cipierre; “never
did Antony de Richelieu look so but there was
evil afoot.”</p>

<p>“I could throw a little light on that, I fancy,
if there was time,” said Marcilly, and as he spoke
we came to the door of the ante-chamber.
Lorgnac had risen to his feet and saluted.</p>

<p>“Is Her Majesty alone, Lorgnac?” asked Cipierre.</p>

<p>“I relieved de Billy but a moment ago, and
since I came no one has passed in or out, Monsieur
le Vicomte, except Richelieu,” replied the
young soldier, “but there are doors within doors
behind me, and I cannot say. The Italian is
within, however, and he may be able to inform
you.”</p>

<p>“Bentivoglio?”</p>

<p>Lorgnac nodded, and stepped aside to let us
pass.</p>

<p>The door shut behind us as noiselessly as it
had opened, and we found ourselves in a room
lit by tall wax candles, standing in grotesque
holders of bronze. On one side was a recess
formed by the bay of a window, and facing us
was a heavy curtain of violet velvet, starred
with the golden lilies of France. A rare tapestry,
representing the deeds of La Pucelle, hung on the
walls, and the door was covered with a matchless
carpet, soft and springy as turf. It was one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>of the gifts brought back by the Embassy to the
Grand Turk. Except for a seat or two, the room
was entirely bare of furniture, and at first I
thought there was no one in it but ourselves.
Another glance, however, showed me the figure
of a man with his face partly turned from us.
He was standing in the half-light of the recess,
holding something over a cresset that hung from
its domed roof. He dropped this into the dim
flame of the lamp, and, a moment after, the pungent
odor of burning aloes filled the room. He
did not at first appear to observe us, but the
clink of our spurs, or maybe scabbards, arrested
his attention, and with a slight start he looked
up, and then moved toward us. The collar of
the Order was round his neck, the golden shells
gleaming against his black velvet pourpoint.</p>

<p>It was Cornelius Bentivoglio, Catherine’s chamberlain,
and as I saw him advancing, a set smile
on his dark features, I thought of that wintertide
in Roche Guyon, when Francis of Bourbon
was foully murdered by the man who stood smiling
before us. I was a boy then, but the story
came to us in the far-off Ruergue, and how, too,
the bravo had boasted that he had avenged the
day of Cerisoles. And now he was a knight of
the King’s Order and a noble of the State. In
after times we who had also been of the Court
knew him well, and I hated and despised him
then. I might hate his memory still, but I dare
not despise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Messieurs!” he said, addressing Sancerre and
the Vicomte, and speaking with a strong foreign
accent, but in good French, “you are welcome.
I was just burning a sprig of aloe. ’Tis a specific
against the plague, as René will have it, and
smells almost as sweetly as a burning Huguenot.
<i>Per Bacco!</i> I did not observe you before, messieurs!
’Tis the Comte de Marcilly, and the Sieur
de Vibrac, as I live! You have been absent long,
gentlemen,” and he showed his white teeth in a
treacherous smile.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Sancerre coldly, “we have come
on an urgent affair&mdash;do us the honor to announce
the Captain of Orleans, and the Comte de Sancerre.”</p>

<p>“<i>Vent’ bleu!</i>” the Italian answered, cutting and
lisping his words with an affected air, “it would
be an honor for me to do so, but”&mdash;and he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;“her Majesty will not
receive. She has been wearied with the day, and
’tis past compline, and besides”&mdash;he dropped his
voice to a whisper&mdash;“Madame is not alone. The
Duke and the Cardinal are with her.”</p>

<p>“At this hour!”</p>

<p>“Faith of a gentleman! Richelieu came here
with red spurs, and strange tidings, and they
followed on his heels. Perhaps, messieurs, he
may have forestalled you,” and he grinned maliciously.</p>

<p>Cipierre would have said something, but there
came a murmur of voices from behind the curtain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the violet folds slipped softly to one side,
and two persons entered the room.</p>

<p>It needed no look at the Golden Fleece on his
broad breast&mdash;he held the Spanish Order&mdash;to recognize
the Lieutenant-General of the kingdom.
His great height, the livid scar of the spear-wound
on his left cheek, his air of imperious command,
gave no chance for any error&mdash;it was the
Guise himself. He stopped short in his passage
through the room to exchange a few words with
Sancerre and the Vicomte, and then, his quick
glance penetrating the shadow of the recess into
which we had retired, he recognized us&mdash;for we
had served under him, in the days when he fought
for the glory of France&mdash;and calling us by name,
he greeted us with that princely courtesy which
belonged to him alone, and under which he could
cloak the deadliest hatred.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “you bring back the air
of the Spanish war with you. ’Tis like a fresh
breeze. Remember, the banner of Guise always
has shadow for a good sword.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness is most kind,” said Marcilly,
and I murmured something under my breath,
my eyes fixed on the curtain, near which stood
another and more sinister figure.</p>

<p>It was the Cardinal of Lorraine. One white
hand, upon which flashed the sapphire of a prince
of the church, still held the velvet folds of the
curtain, against which the scarlet of his robes
stood out in rich contrast. He was tall, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>as tall as his brother, and held himself as proudly.
He had the same bold, high features, but the sternness
on Guise’s lip became cruelty on his, the fire
of undaunted courage in the Duke’s glance, for
he was brave among the brave, gave place in the
churchman to the malign fire that blazes in the
eyes of a wolf, and, like the wolf he was pitiless
and treacherous. He was learned, eloquent, and
witty, but there were strange tales about him&mdash;how
he was a craven at heart, how in secret he
mocked at religion. There were stories of orgies
at Bel Esbat, his stately seat, that might have
brought a blush to the cheeks of Borgia. There
were whispers of hideous crimes, of fits of bitter
repentance, followed by reckless outbursts of
shameless sin. Of these I know nothing of the
truth, save that the tongue of scandal was busy
with his name. All that I can think of now is
that, as I saw him there, his searching glance
striving to read every thought on the faces of
the group before him, it came to me to rid France
of the vampire who drank her blood; but the Lord
spared him then, to be a scourge to his country
for many a long year to come.</p>

<p>So he stood for a moment, and then passed
slowly out of the room, taking no more notice
of us than if we had been flies; but the Duke still
lingered, as if he would discover what our business
was, and yet dared not compromise his
dignity by asking a direct question. Cipierre
answered him in short yeas and nays, and Sancerre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
fenced with him like the skilful courtier he
was, and then His Highness changed the conversation,
and repeated his offers of service to us.
We respectfully declined them for the present, and
he said, with that high grave air of his:</p>

<p>“Very well, gentlemen! Let it be as you wish,
but forget not that the sauce of a Guise is as
good as the sauce of a Prince of the blood.”</p>

<p>And then, with the hidden meaning of his words
in our ears, he left us, tall and stately, a soldier
whom we would have followed to the death,
but that his sword was red to the hilt with the
blood of his country.</p>

<p>“<i>Diavolo!</i>” said the chamberlain; “Monseigneur
is in one of his gracious moods&mdash;he meditates a
blow.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Cipierre looked him full in the face,
saying:</p>

<p>“Monsieur&mdash;if you please.”</p>

<p>There was something in the Vicomte’s tone that
could not be denied, and without an answer the
Italian passed into the cabinet. He came out
again almost at once, saying:</p>

<p>“Her Majesty will receive you, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel, and betook himself
to burning his aloes once more.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WIDOW OF FRANCE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was a small room, the curtains at the windows
were drawn, and a fire burned brightly in
the grate. On the polished oak of the floor, black
with age, were scattered rare eastern carpets,
low, cushioned seats, carved tables, and cabinets,
holding those delicate and elegant trifles a woman
loves&mdash;strange carvings, crystals of Venice, rare
articles of <i>faience</i>, caskets, and vases wrought in
quaint designs.</p>

<p>On the writing-table, a winged Mercury, the
work of Benvenuto Cellini, held a lamp which
filled the room with its amber light. Near the
window was a clavichord, and hard by it was
a lute left carelessly on a stool, whilst Nambu,
the Queen’s Barbary ape, slept profoundly on the
yellow satin cushions covering the window-seat.
Here and there were a few books. An illuminated
breviary in a golden case, with the arms of
France set in brilliants thereon, lay on a <i>prie-dieu</i>
made from the wood of the gates of the
Holy Sepulchre. Beside this was carelessly flung
a fan of marabout feathers, a vinaigrette, and a
pair of gloves, while against the wall, overhanging
these things, was a large golden cross, on
which a Christ writhed in his last agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>On the writing-desk, its pages open, was a volume
of “The Prince,” by Machiavel the Florentine.
In a cabinet near were some books&mdash;the
“Odes of Ronsard,” the “Commentaries of Cæsar,”
the “Lives of Plutarch,” and, strangely
enough, the songs of Clement Marot.</p>

<p>There was time to see all this and more, for
when we entered the cabinet it was empty, and
I let my eyes run over my surroundings, more
in idle curiosity than with any hope of gathering
from them an index to the character of the
strange woman, whom we all thought a figure
of wax while her husband lived, but whose hidden
strength was now beginning to be felt and
feared. For five-and-twenty years, as wife and
queen, she had suffered insult and contumely, such
as falls to the lot of few women to bear. She
had seen her rights as a wife and mother usurped,
and the most brutal speech that has ever, perhaps,
been made to a queen by a subject, had
been flung at her by Anne de Montmorenci. She
had endured and waited, until at length the time
was white for her harvest of vengeance, and then
she reaped. No pity had been shown to her, and
she had learned how to be merciless. One by one
her enemies had fallen. Diana was gone. That
was indeed a day of triumph, when the insolent
favorite was expelled from the Louvre! Then
came the turn of others; but Montmorenci still
lived, the first peer of the kingdom, Constable of
France. In her eagerness to strike at him, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>once the crafty Italian overreached herself, and
fell into the snares set for her by her deadliest
foes. How she escaped the Guise; how she humbled
herself and sought the friendship of the Constable;
how she played off ambition against ambition,
party against party, and maintained her
position to the last, are matters foreign to this
story of the disaster of my life. I have merely
digressed thus, to give some insight into the character
of the woman we are to meet, a character
so warped by the years of duplicity she had
been forced to exercise, that it had become impossible
for her to follow a straight course, even
when such a course showed no difficulty against
the attainment of her ends.</p>

<p>As we waited for Catherine, Marcilly turned
toward a little table near to him, and picked up
a bouquet of violets set in a holder of golden filagree.
He was about to inhale the fragrance of
the flowers, when Sancerre put his hand on his
wrist, saying:</p>

<p>“<i>Par le mordieu!</i> Monsieur! Have you been
so long away from the Court not to know that
the scent of flowers here is sometimes unhealthy?”</p>

<p>Jean put down the bouquet with a slight start,
and Cipierre paled a little beneath his sunburn, as
he muttered something under his breath, and then
checked himself, for a door we had not observed,
so hidden was it in the wainscoting, opened
slightly, and a figure stepped into the room.</p>

<p>It was Catherine, and I confess it was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>without an emotion of misgiving and dislike that
I saw the Queen-Mother again. She was tall for
a woman, and inclined to stoutness, but her features,
beneath the low, triangular cap she wore,
were pale and clear-cut, and in the sleepy deeps
of her dark eyes there gleamed a power and a
strength, a light that had never shone in them
when her husband was King.</p>

<p>Except for the lace ruff at her neck, she was
all in black, and at the golden girdle round her
waist hung a small poniard, the handle inlaid
with gems, a string of <i>têtes-de-mort</i>, and an
ebony crucifix. She came toward us with a
firm but slow step, bending slightly to our bow,
and appearing not to recognize either Marcilly
or myself, looked at our companions, as she said
in a quiet, even voice:</p>

<p>“Messieurs! The hour is late. It must be a
matter of urgency that brings you here.”</p>

<p>“It is, madame,” replied Sancerre; “we bring
you news, and in connection with that news
monsieur, the Captain of Orleans, and I require
the orders of the King.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! And the news?” As she spoke she
took the violets from the holder Marcilly had
laid down, and held them idly in her slender, delicate
hand.</p>

<p>“The Admiral has written to the Constable
urging him to move at once on Orleans, and
Montmorenci is in strong force now at Yvoy le
Marron.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>They looked at each other steadily as Sancerre
spoke, each with the same thought in their hearts,
each trying to conceal that thought from the
other. How much Sancerre knew I am not sure;
it was only in after years I discovered that it
was Catherine herself who had prompted the
sending of the Admiral’s letter. In her desperate
attempt to free herself from the Guise, she was
willing to take any step, however humiliating,
though it must have been gall and wormwood
to have been compelled to seek aid from Anne de
Montmorenci.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to hide some expression of this
on her features that she suddenly turned, and
with a quick movement of her hand cast the violets
into the fire; then she faced Sancerre again,
saying:</p>

<p>“I know all this and more. I know, too, that
the Princess of Condé is close to Orleans, on her
way here&mdash;here!” she repeated, with a slight laugh.</p>

<p>“Ah! This was the news Richelieu brought!”
It was Cipierre who spoke, and Catherine laughed
again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps! But I know even more. Monsieur
of Arles writes to say that certain men of his
guard have been attacked and slain by the following
of the Princess, and”&mdash;here she glanced
at us&mdash;“I know, moreover, that swords have
been drawn on my captain of Chenonceaux in
broad day, by those who call themselves faithful
servants of the King.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Madame,” answered Sancerre, “if those swords
had not been drawn, the Admiral’s letter would
never have reached.”</p>

<p>She began to play with the poniard at her girdle,
and to bite her under lip. Cipierre stood
grim and silent, and Sancerre watched her with
an odd smile on his face, half-amused, half-sarcastic,
as he waited for his reply; but, none coming,
he continued:</p>

<p>“Would your Majesty prefer our taking our orders
on these matters from the Duke of Guise,
or the Cardinal of Lorraine?”</p>

<p>“<i>Mille démons!</i>” muttered Cipierre, and the
Queen said, in an icy voice:</p>

<p>“As the matter is urgent I will deal with it
now. The Princess must not come to Orleans,
you understand, and the Constable should be
warned that he comes at his peril.”</p>

<p>“This will be done, but Anne de Montmorenci
will take the risk.”</p>

<p>“That is his affair!” She shrugged her shoulders;
yet there was a momentary flash of triumph
in her eyes. She had got the news she wanted,
the certainty that the Constable would move;
and now, as if to end the interview, she said:</p>

<p>“This is all, gentlemen, is it not?”</p>

<p>“All, madame, except one thing. We have two
prisoners here, who voluntarily surrender to your
Majesty, and beseech your mercy toward them.”</p>

<p>At these words both Marcilly and I started, but
Sancerre gave us a warning glance, and gripped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>Cipierre by the arm, as if to restrain him from
speech.</p>

<p>She was looking at us now with a faint smile,
whether in mockery or not, playing on the corners
of her lips.</p>

<p>“So these are the prisoners,” she said; “I know
these gentlemen as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Faithful servants of the King, and of the House
of Valois,” said Sancerre, adding, as he lowered
his voice, “there is still time before all is lost.”</p>

<p>“Before all is lost.” She repeated the words
mechanically, and then, as if grasping the full
significance of their meaning, she became for a
space unconscious of our presence, standing before
us as if she was alone with herself. For a
breath it seemed as if that dark and subtle heart
was to lay aside the mask that covered it.
“Lost!” she murmured. “Is it for this my hands
are red?” she shuddered slightly, and then recovered
herself, her face strangely white, her lips
pale. “No! Not yet! I hold cards too!” She
laughed bitterly. “Ah, Guise? ’Tis a woman’s
wit against all your strength!” Then, with an
effort, she brought herself to the moment, and
turned to us, once more the actress, once more
incapable of pursuing an open course.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” she said, addressing Jean and myself,
“I thank you for coming here. But you have
done wrong&mdash;expect no help from me&mdash;none. M.
de Guise knows of your coming&mdash;there is but one
order I can give, but I will give you time ere I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>issue it. I give you until sunrise to-morrow to
escape.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” replied Marcilly, “we weighed the
risk before we came. We have not come here like
bats in the night, to flit away like bats with the
dawn. Madame, trust us!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mordieu!</i> Madame! You have no traitors
around you for once. Do not lose any chance,
however small!” It was Cipierre who spoke, impatient
at her fencing.</p>

<p>“Traitors! The very tapestry in this room has
eyes and ears&mdash;aye! and tongues too!” she answered.
“But I believe you. For once I believe
there are no traitors around me.”</p>

<p>And I, who was about to be the blackest of
traitors, though I knew it not then, felt a glow
coming over me at the words.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Sancerre, “then act on that
belief. This is no time for hesitation. Cannot you
see what the Guise will do at the first hint of the
Constable’s moving? The Prince must be saved.
He, and he alone, can make head against Lorraine.
With his death there would be an end to
us. We must play every card now.”</p>

<p>Catherine looked around the room as if seeking
to find words for her reply. At last she broke
out:</p>

<p>“What would you have me do? I am powerless.
Ah!”&mdash;she hissed, rather than spoke&mdash;“they
compass me like bees&mdash;I can give you no help.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has only to extend to us the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>King’s peace for our late alleged offences,” said
Marcilly. “We would then be free of the streets
of Orleans. That is all the aid we seek. We answer
for the rest.”</p>

<p>“We must get that to-night if it is to be of any
use,” I added.</p>

<p>She had played her game long enough, whatever
her object was in thus delaying. Perhaps it
was to test our sincerity. Who can tell? But
now she yielded, yet even in yielding remained
an actress. She glanced at me for a moment,
and then turned to Marcilly with a smile on her
face.</p>

<p>“<i>Monsieur le Comte!</i> There is some one else
whose pardon you should first seek, for not having
seen her before. You will find her waiting in
the passage,” and with a wave of her hand she
indicated the door by which she had entered the
room.</p>

<p>I knew what she meant, and for a moment my
brain seemed to reel; but I felt the Queen’s eyes
on me, and steadied myself. Marcilly had gone
like a flash, but as he opened the door there was
a glad cry&mdash;such a cry, such a tone as could only
come from the heart of a woman who loved, and
it stabbed me like a knife. I knew in a moment
that my house of cards had come down. I felt&mdash;I
cannot tell why&mdash;that the love I thought mine
was never mine, and with this sprang up a bitter
resentment against Marie. It was Jean whom
she loved, whom she had always loved, and I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
had been fooled. To think that I had been fighting
a phantom all this time! To think that those
struggles with myself, those victories gained, those
hours of abasement, were due to a spectre of my
own creating! How different would the past
year have been had I but known! Had I but
guessed! But to have been fooled! To have
been made a sport and plaything, to while away
the dull hours of a born coquette&mdash;I, Gaspard
de Vibrac, Knight of the King’s Order! In a
moment it seemed that all my love had turned
to a bitter hatred. There was a new madness
burning in me, not the madness of passion, of
love, but the more baleful fires of hatred and
revenge.</p>

<p>And I was wrong even then in the conclusion
I jumped to. I know now that it is possible for
a woman, a good and pure woman, to mistake
the feelings of her heart, to imagine she loves
where she does not, and to tread on the edge of
a moral precipice, where a false step means the
ruin of a soul. And because such a woman was
strong enough to save herself, I was base enough
to brand her coquette, vile enough to think of
revenge. I could hear nothing except that glad
cry of welcome; I saw as in a dream before me
the figures of the Queen-Mother and our two
friends engaged in earnest converse. What they
said was nothing to me. I did not hear a word.
Once or twice I fancied they looked at me, but I
paid no heed to them, standing a little apart,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>leaning on the hilt of my sword, my soul once
more adrift on that dark sea from which but so
short a while since I thought I had come safe to
port. So I stood until the tension was broken
by Catherine’s measured voice:</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac! Be so good as to call
Bentivoglio here. We will see the King at once.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING’S PEACE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> started</span> at the words; but they brought me
to myself, and with a bow I turned and passed
into the ante-chamber. Some one was just quitting
the room as I entered, for I caught the flash
of a gay cloak as the Italian closed the door opposite
to me, after his departing visitor, and then
turned round with that eternal, treacherous smile
of his, saying:</p>

<p>“<i>Per Bacco!</i> Your audience has been a long one!”</p>

<p>“’Tis likely to be longer still. Her Majesty
wishes to see you. We go to the King.”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyebrows slightly at my last words,
only saying, however, as he stepped to the archway:</p>

<p>“Her nightly visit. It will not continue for
long.”</p>

<p>“Is it really so bad?”</p>

<p>He stopped, his hands resting on the folds of
the curtain; then, bending forward, he said in a
low tone:</p>

<p>“I keep relays of horses to two frontiers.”</p>

<p>There was no more said, and we stepped into
the cabinet. Marcilly had returned, radiant and
happy; but, in the quick glance I cast around
me on entering I did not see Marie, and from my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>soul I was glad of this. I could not have endured
meeting her. In the tumult then in my heart it
would have been impossible to have faced her
without betraying myself.</p>

<p>There was a whispered word or so between
Catherine and her chamberlain, and then she
spoke loudly, and with an imperious note in her
voice:</p>

<p>“To the King&mdash;by the private way!” and, the
Italian leading, we followed the Queen-Mother
through the door by which she had entered the
cabinet, and along a passage lighted by a small
lamp at its extreme end. Here we came to another
door, which Bentivoglio opened with a
master-key, and, free of this, found ourselves at
the base of a wide stairway that led to the apartments
of the King.</p>

<p>All was in light&mdash;in white, dazzling light. There
was a quick word of command, a flash of steel,
the guard of the King’s Carabiniers presented
arms, and Richelieu stepped forward, no longer
the reckless soldier, but the suave courtier. The
Star of the Order gleamed upon his silver cuirass,
his short scarlet cloak was thrown back over his
broad shoulders, and the blood-red plumes of his
hat swept the polished flooring as he bowed before
the Medicis.</p>

<p>“The King&mdash;my son&mdash;how is he?” asked Catherine.</p>

<p>“But as before, madame. His Majesty has asked
for your Grace twice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>The Queen-Mother crossed herself, and, preceded
by Richelieu and followed by us, began to ascend
the stairs, at the head of which we could see a
gaily dressed group assembled, and among them
some ladies, maids of honor, no doubt, to the
reigning Queen.</p>

<p>The balustrade terminated in a square column
of veined granite, upon which was set a marble
Aphrodite, one arm outstretched as if casting a
flower. From the rear of the party, where I was
with Bentivoglio, who had dropped to my side,
the lights made the goddess burn a rose-red, as
if the statue were a living, palpitating thing.
And, as I looked, a figure moved out of the throng
above us, and stood beside the Venus; the figure
of a woman, tall and stately, with deep, sleepy
eyes and passionate lips, a living embodiment of
the artist’s dream.</p>

<p>The Italian nudged me, for he saw too. “The
Limeuil,” he whispered, “for whom your Condé
will lose his honor.”</p>

<p>Ay! The words were almost prophetic, for it
was for the sake of this woman before us that
Condé, he for whom we were risking so much,
trailed the honor of Bourbon in the dust, and
broke the true heart of his wife, casting aside
the priceless ruby for the sham, glittering crystal.
If ever man was a moral murderer, he was; but
he died like a gentleman and a soldier, while I&mdash;no,
I dare not cast a stone!</p>

<p>And even as I write this there comes to me the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>memory of that grim story of the field of Jarnac,
of that last devoted charge, for the sweet peril
of Christ and the Fatherland, of Montesquieu’s
deed of blood, and of that red sunset when Anjou
stood in doubt and hesitation before a stripped
and mangled corpse.</p>

<p>And there came a cry from those around, “She
comes! She comes!” and a tall, veiled woman
stepped slowly forward through the battle-worn
group. Casting aside her veil, she looked long,
with cold, hard eyes, on the disfigured features
of the dead, and suddenly she laughed&mdash;a laugh
that chilled the blood of all&mdash;as she pointed in
triumph with her jewelled hand to the thing at
her feet.</p>

<p>“It is he, Condé,” she said. “<i>Enfin!</i>” and she
kicked the dead face with her dainty shoe.</p>

<p>And while I gazed at her, we reached the landing,
where all bowed with reverence to the Widow
of France, as Catherine was called.</p>

<p>As we came up there was a slight murmur of
surprise and curiosity, which even the presence
of the Queen-Mother was unable to totally suppress,
and there were inquiring looks and glances
interchanged, for it takes but a short time to forget
in a court, and we, who had been but last
year so well known, were almost as strangers
now.</p>

<p>I could not forbear a glance at the Limeuil,
which she returned with interest, coquette to her
finger-tips; and then, dropping her large eyes, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>whispered something to a girl beside her, with a
little laugh, as musical as the chime of a bell.</p>

<p>We were, however, not altogether unknown.
Some one&mdash;I could not see whom&mdash;did recognize
us, and I distinctly caught the words:</p>

<p>“What madness! To come back now!”</p>

<p>“Ay! Two more flies in the cobweb.”</p>

<p>I turned to the voices. The first speaker I
could not make out, but the second I was certain
of. It was the jester of the Martroi. He was
leaning against the wall, swinging his bauble,
and surrounded by a group of three or four people,
listening, no doubt, to his quips and jests.</p>

<p>All this occurred very rapidly, and then we
passed the landing, passed the folding-doors, and
entered the ante-chamber beyond. Some of those
who were on the landing followed us, the jester
among the number; but here we were all stopped
by a chamberlain, and Catherine, attended but
by Sancerre and Cipierre, entered the private
apartments of the King.</p>

<p>Marcilly and I stood alone, a little apart from
the rest, who were grouped in knots, conversing
in low, subdued tones. Bentivoglio had approached
the jester and some others who were
gathered round Mademoiselle de Limeuil, and
Richelieu, after a quick word or so with the
guard at the King’s door, turned as if to join
them, but, changing his mind, came toward us
and, bowing, said:</p>

<p>“Permit me, messieurs, to present myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“It is unnecessary,” I said; “the Sieur de Richelieu
needs no presentation.”</p>

<p>“In a way we are already acquainted,” smiled
Jean.</p>

<p>“Ah!” and Richelieu twisted his heavy moustache;
“I never thought I could have been so deceived.
Your resemblance to the Prince is simply
marvellous.”</p>

<p>“Your mistake was fortunate for me, though,”
said Marcilly.</p>

<p>Richelieu laughed. “For the first time in my
life I thought I had seen a ghost. I confess I
was fairly unnerved. But, messieurs, since two
at least of us have exchanged a pass together,
and since, as I understand, the King has recovered
two good swords, I would ask the favor of
your joining me at my quarters, after this is over,
to empty a skin of Gascony.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible, I regret to say,” replied Marcilly,
and I added my excuses.</p>

<p>“We will get le Brusquet to come,” he urged;
“the jester sings rarely, and has a merry wit.”</p>

<p>But it was not to be, and Richelieu took our
excuses with an air of disappointment and a little
annoyance.</p>

<p>I, for one, had my doubts about this sudden
geniality on the part of Antony de Richelieu, and
these doubts were not set at rest by the chagrin
he displayed. My thoughts, however, were diverted
from this matter, for, as Richelieu expressed
his disappointment to us, the door of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>King’s chamber opened as if to let some one pass,
and at the same moment we heard a high-pitched,
querulous voice:</p>

<p>“Lights! I want more lights! Where is Marie?
I cannot see her.”</p>

<p>It was the King who spoke. Every murmur
was stilled where we were, and the door closed
softly again, no one coming forth. For a moment
or so there was absolute silence, and all
glanced anxiously at one another, reading in each
other’s faces and eyes the confirmation of their
misgivings. For there was in that voice an expression
of pain and suffering, an intolerable
agony, that told its own tale. It was a presage
of the end to be, that filled us with pity and awe,
and kept the most heedless tongue checked. At
last some one&mdash;I know not whom&mdash;said softly,
yet not so low but that the words reached us:</p>

<p>“He calls for the Queen.”</p>

<p>“She is with him,” answered the Limeuil; adding:
“He is better; the fever has quite gone.
René himself told me so.”</p>

<p>“That was the Jesuit’s Bark,” remarked Bentivoglio;
“’tis a rare specific.”</p>

<p>“Ay, rare indeed!” said the one who had first
spoken, adding, “Is it true he is to be blooded
in the tongue?”</p>

<p>Bentivoglio shrugged his shoulders; but now
the door opened once more, and there stepped out
a tall figure, robed in brown taffeta, with a small
cap of black velvet on his head. It was René
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>himself, and he was immediately surrounded by
a group, and eagerly questioned as to the King’s
health. But for the present their curiosity had to
be satisfied with a brief “The King is better,” and
René, to whom we were known, turned to us
and, beckoning with his hand, said:</p>

<p>“Messieurs! Have the goodness to follow me.”</p>

<p>Then, as we followed the physician, we heard
whispers and murmurs, while eager questions,
mingled with our names, flew from mouth to
mouth, for curiosity had not been idle as we
stood awaiting our audience. There were one
or two who had recognized us, not to speak of
Bentivoglio and Richelieu, and these were only
too ready to pass their information on; so that
as much as could be known of us was known
already to that idle crowd of human moths, that
clung to the corridors and tapestries of the palace.</p>

<p>“They have been pardoned, I hear,” said one.</p>

<p>“How can that be?” was the reply; “the amnesty
is over.”</p>

<p>“They might use Marcilly as a living effigy for
the Prince&mdash;he would do well for a proxy,” said
the jester; and then amid the buzzing I caught
another speech that made me burn. It came from
the red lips of Isabel de Limeuil.</p>

<p>“So that is de Vibrac! What was that story
about him and&mdash;&mdash;” I did not hear the rest, although
I could guess; and with an inward curse
at the tongue of scandal, that seemed to be able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>to stretch across space and time, I followed the
physician and Jean into the King’s chamber, the
huissier, in violet and gold, closing the door after
us, shutting out the buzzing voices, and the prying
eyes of the restless crowd in the ante-room.</p>

<p>“Lights! I want more light!” The breeze, as
it sweeps through my open study window, and
past the dark, shaking curtains, seems to bring
with it the thin, high voice of the King; and as
I write these lines, I can see before me that room,
in bright, glaring light&mdash;a light that almost pained
the eyes to look upon, and yet was but twilight
to the dim sight of that poor, dying boy, who
stared at us from his proppings of cushions, and
who was now on the threshold of that long,
dark night, that, with God’s mercy, was to bring
with it a morning, brilliant with the splendor
that the eye of man has not seen, glorious with
the glory of the infinite star-lands of Eternity.</p>

<p>But what caught us, what arrested our attention,
so that it could not linger for a moment
on the rich and luxurious room, so that we hardly
saw the group before us, so that we but seemed
to realize, as though it were an angelic thing of
air, the figure of a woman standing at the bedside,
and looking with infinite compassion and
tenderness on the pain-worn face beneath her,
was that face itself. There it was, shining out
white and pallid from the white pillows, with
that one red spot on the forehead, the crimson
seal of that terrible sickness, of that awful disease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
which showed itself in the last stages of
Francis’s illness, and which, even if he had lived,
would have placed him among those whom
men set aside from themselves as accursed by
God, among those whom man may pity in his
heart, yet never look upon without horror and
loathing.</p>

<p>There are those who deny the story, and, in
truth, the King died before the new sickness had
developed. Its presence was unsuspected by all
except two&mdash;even the Queen, Mary of Scotland,
who now stood bending with sweet, pitiful eyes
over her husband, did not dream of it; but René
knew, and Catherine knew, and I knew when I
saw, for it had come upon a man so in the Sicilies,
when I served there with Ponthieu, and it
was not to be mistaken.</p>

<p>To my mind the King might have lived, but
for that scar on his forehead. He died, as we
know, of a pain in the ear, as Bentivoglio mockingly
said, and the phrase has become a byword.</p>

<p>There is, however, a chapter of history that has
yet to be told, but he who writes it must first
learn the secrets that lie locked up in the hearts
of the dead, for Catherine is gone and René sleeps
his last sleep.</p>

<p>Ay! I can picture it all&mdash;the hopes, the fears,
and then the dread certainty. Then comes the
struggle between the love of a mother and the
pride of race. It is a choice between unspeakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
shame and death that hides all things. The
Queen-Mother and René are alone together with
the King. He sleeps, and the lights that ever
blaze within the room burn on that red splash,
the mark of the Unclean. The eyes of Catherine
meet those of René, and the man of science knows
that the choice has been made&mdash;that pride has
conquered love.</p>

<p>“It must be now,” she says, and then, with
head held high, and dry, burning eyes, the Medicis
steps from the room.</p>

<p>And René was alone with his King. What happened
then will never be known until the last
great trumpet blares out its call, and you and I,
my friends, stand at God’s Throne to answer for
our souls; but when the morning came, Charles
the Ninth was King of France.</p>

<p>All this was to happen in a few days, nay, in
a few hours; but at the moment, in the hearts
of those who stood around, had sprung up a
hope&mdash;the fever was gone&mdash;the King would live.</p>

<p>We stepped forward and knelt by the bedside,
and the thin hand of the boy wavered over us
as he asked:</p>

<p>“Are these my friends come back?”</p>

<p>Then Catherine bent down and whispered in
his ear, and Francis spoke again.</p>

<p>“Pardon them! I would have pardoned them
all. There was Castelnau, who used to play
with me when I was a boy. There was Ste.
Marie, who taught me to ride. There is Condé,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>always gay and laughing. And I&mdash;I have not
laughed for months.” He stopped for a moment,
and went on, “But my cousin of Guise and the
Cardinal will not let me pardon any one&mdash;they
forbid it,” he added weakly.</p>

<p>“My son,” said the Medicis, “are you not King
of France?”</p>

<p>A faint flush spread over the ivory face, the
pale lips drew themselves together obstinately,
and he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! I am King,” and then, in a louder
tone, “I will be King for once&mdash;shall I not, Marie?”
and he turned to his wife.</p>

<p>And the most beautiful lips in the world pleaded
for us, and put courage into the heart of the
King; and, boy as he was, there seemed to come
upon him all the dignity of his high estate, as he
stretched out his hand again to us.</p>

<p>“I pardon you the past, messieurs&mdash;I give you
the King’s Peace&mdash;the peace that the King himself
knows not.”</p>

<p>Then we touched the thin hand with our lips,
and, rising without a word, for there was something
in the moment that took speech from us,
stepped behind the group at the head of the bed,
as the little King leaned back again on his pillows,
all trace of the momentary strength in his
face vanishing. Catherine turned toward us, as
if about to give us the signal to go, when the
King spoke again.</p>

<p>“My mother,” he said, “am I going to die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>A look of pain came over the marble features
of Catherine; she bent over the boy, as if to hide
her features, and her voice was very low as she
answered: “No, no, my son!”</p>

<p>And the child had become a child once more.</p>

<p>“I do not want to die,” he wailed. “I am King.
Why should a King die?” He stopped and beckoned
to Cipierre.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, as the Vicomte approached,
“you are a brave soldier; you have fought many
battles. You must save your King from death.”</p>

<p>The veteran half turned away as he answered:</p>

<p>“I, and all your soldiers, my King, would die
to save you.”</p>

<p>“Then you will not let death come? It comes
in the dark, monsieur; that is why I always have
these lights. You must not let death come. You
must stand there! There!” He pointed to the
foot of the bed, and went on: “And my guards,
who would die for me, must stand around, then
death will not touch the King of France.”</p>

<p>I saw the features of the old war-wolf work
convulsively as he bowed before the King and
muttered hoarsely, “It shall be done.”</p>

<p>There was no word spoken now. There was
nothing to say. The lights burned brightly on
the pallid features of the boy, who had flung himself
back amid his pillows, and wearily closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>We stood still, looking at each other in silence.
I saw Catherine and René exchange a glance, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>then from behind us came a single, half-suppressed
sob. It was from the heart of the fair young
Queen, as, with a quick, sudden movement, she
turned and passed into an inner apartment.</p>

<p>And the Medicis spoke now in her icy, measured
voice:</p>

<p>“Messieurs, the King sleeps.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING’S SIGNET</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>owing</span> low, we stepped from the King’s bedside
and moved toward the door, Catherine
stopping Sancerre to give a last injunction: “You
will leave by the private way, through my apartments&mdash;tell
Bentivoglio.”</p>

<p>She was answered in an undertone, so that I
could not catch the speech, and the next moment
we re-entered the ante-chamber, closely followed
by René.</p>

<p>Those whom we had left were still there, in
curious expectation; but René repeated to them
the words of the Medicis, “The King sleeps,” and
there followed the murmurs of low converse, and
a subdued bustle of departure, only those remaining
whose duties required them to stay&mdash;a page
or so, the officer of the night, and the archers at
the door.</p>

<p>Bentivoglio and Richelieu moved together toward
us, and Sancerre, whispering Catherine’s
command in the chamberlain’s ear, turned to
Richelieu and said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur! You will await Her Majesty the
Queen-Mother here.”</p>

<p>A dark shade gathered on Richelieu’s brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“I command the guards in the galleries,” he
answered. “Monsieur de Baillieul”&mdash;and he indicated
a tall, grim-looking soldier who stood
stiffly, a little apart from the others&mdash;“is on duty
here to-night.”</p>

<p>“You do not follow me, Monsieur de Richelieu,”
said Sancerre. “I said your orders were to await
Her Majesty. It remains for you to obey or not,”
and with that the old count swung round on his
heel and moved forward to the stairway, leaving
Richelieu biting his moustache with anger.</p>

<p>We exchanged a glance as we passed, and I
read enough in Richelieu’s eye to understand that
it was not any delay in getting at his skin of
wine that touched him, but that this order of
Catherine had crossed some design which had
little to do with the jests of le Brusquet or the
vintage of Gascogne.</p>

<p>We left him, apparently debating in his mind
whether he should obey the commands he had
received or not, and returned as we came. On
entering the passage leading to Catherine’s apartments,
Marcilly and I were side by side, and he
put his hand on my arm with a friendly pressure,
as he said, “I think we win.”</p>

<p>Oh! Win or lose! It was all one to me now;
but the touch of his hand stirred the smouldering
hate in my heart toward the man who had
come between me and the woman I loved. I
shrank back from him, muttering something&mdash;I
do not know myself what&mdash;and thankful for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>gloom that hid the expression which must have
passed over my features.</p>

<p>It is a profound and awful mystery that man
should carry within himself the poison that can
kill his soul. Who shall fathom this strange
thing? Not you nor I, my friends; but it remains
true that the Almighty hand has placed side by
side in our hearts the noblest aspirations and the
most deadly passions. It is as if a gardener rears,
with infinite pain and labor, a beautiful plant,
and then grafts on to it a poisonous cutting,
whose growth means death to the exquisite thing
on which such labor and such care has been
spent.</p>

<p>And the poison herbs were growing apace
within me now, spreading their long arms about
my soul, choking, with their creeping growth, all
the manly, the noble, the pure thoughts that,
but for my own folly, might have made me a
man fit to hold my head high among my fellows.</p>

<p>All these thoughts did not pass through me
then. They came with the after years, with memory,
with shame, and a too late repentance. But
at the time when I shrank back from Marcilly
and followed my companions, the last of all, I
was conscious only of a hideous turmoil in my
soul; and I saw, with an ever-increasing dread
and horror, that I had again approached the
edge of that abyss from which but so short a
while back I thought I had escaped, and whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>dark deeps were now calling me down to them
with an irresistible force.</p>

<p>In a few paces we reached the cabinet. Bentivoglio,
with suave politeness, held open the door
to let us pass, and as I stepped in, the last of all,
I became conscious that there was some one there.
For the figure of a woman arose from a chair
near the window, where she had been sitting caressing
Nambu, the Barbary ape, and stood in
the half-light awaiting us to advance.</p>

<p>A second glance assured me that it was no
other than Mary of Scotland, the young Queen of
France herself, and with that recognition there
came to me like lightning the thought that something
had arisen to thwart our plans, else why
should she, the secret friend of Condé, be here,
and evidently expecting us?</p>

<p>For a moment we stood in irresolute surprise,
and then the Italian recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty&mdash;here&mdash;and alone,” he began;
but she stopped him with a slight gesture of the
hand, and, turning to Sancerre, said with that
sweet, low voice of hers:</p>

<p>“My Lord! This should have been given to
you by the Queen, my mother. ’Tis the King’s
signet. Take it now.” She placed the ring in
Sancerre’s hand, as she added, a little sadly: “I
could trust no one to give it to you. This will
pass you, and”&mdash;she hesitated a little&mdash;“your
friends free, for there are those who would try
and stop you, even to-night, on the chance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>the King’s pardon being recalled to-morrow.
Nay, not a word, Sancerre!” she went on, with
a slight flush on her face, as the old man began
to pour forth his thanks, “It is for the cause we
all have at heart, and may God give you success!”</p>

<p>Then Louis de Beuil knelt before his Queen.
“Your Majesty had in us loyal and faithful subjects
before&mdash;you now have men who are your
very slaves.” So saying, he touched her hand
with his lips, and, rising to his feet, stood beside
her, a towering figure, looking, with his long
white beard and silver hair, like some good enchanter
of the legends of romance.</p>

<p>It was a curious picture&mdash;the light from the
Mercury flickering over the room, the ape cowering
among his cushions, staring at us with
bead-like, unthinking eyes, the group of stern
men around that fair young figure, that Queen
who was Queen for but a day.</p>

<p>There as she stood, with the lights and shadows
playing on her, and her sweet, trustful face
turned toward us, I caught myself wondering
why should she&mdash;the niece of Guise&mdash;be doing her
utmost to help his most deadly foe? Was it pity
alone? Or was there truth in the whisperings
of the Court, that Mary of Scotland had lost her
heart, ere she was Queen of France, to the gay
and gallant Bourbon, and that in secret she was
ever true to her love? And even as I put these
thoughts from me, the Queen broke the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“Messieurs! It is late. We must ask Bentivoglio
to conduct us to the King.”</p>

<p>With a slight inclination of her head, and preceded
by Bentivoglio, she left the cabinet. When
she had gone, we gathered round Sancerre, who
stood near the lamp, the ring in his hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Tudieu!</i>” he laughed, as he slipped the signet
on his finger. “I see now why Richelieu wished
to accompany us. I would wager my best hawk
against a hedge-crow that we meet him yet.
Come, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>So saying, he led the way from the cabinet toward
the outer gateway, where Lorgnac was
yet at his vigil.</p>

<p>“Still on duty!” said Cipierre, stopping to exchange
a word with the lieutenant of the guard,
who was a favorite of his.</p>

<p>“As you see, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“What! Do they make you watch all night?
It was not so in my time.”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur!” replied the young soldier; “but
till midnight, when Crequi relieves me&mdash;good-night,
messieurs!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, de Lorgnac!” We returned his
greeting and, moving quickly along the corridor,
gained the entrance hall, where we found that
Sancerre’s words were true, for Richelieu was
there, warming himself at the fire, and, ranged
near the door, stood at least a dozen of his carabiniers.</p>

<p>We looked at one another in surprise, and Richelieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
stopped rubbing his hands together at the
blaze in the grate; then, putting on his plumed
hat, that lay on a chair beside him, he came
toward us.</p>

<p>As he approached, Sancerre addressed him:
“You here, monsieur! I had thought your duties
were with the Queen-Mother.”</p>

<p>“My duties are where my orders carry me,”
sneered Richelieu, “and, at the moment, these
duties are painful&mdash;to others.” Then turning to
us, he said, in a loud voice: “Messieurs de Marcilly
and de Vibrac, I arrest you in the King’s
name! Your swords, please, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“<i>Morbleu!</i>” exclaimed Cipierre. “This is too
much, monsieur! I demand your authority!”</p>

<p>Richelieu shrugged his shoulders. “It is at the
door, Monsieur le Vicomte,” and he pointed to
his troopers where they stood, grim and motionless.</p>

<p>There was a veiled triumph in his voice, a
studied insolence in his manner, that made our
blood boil, and Cipierre, ever hasty, was roused
at once.</p>

<p>“You will do this at your peril, sir,” he began,
but Sancerre stayed him, and, turning toward
Richelieu, looked him steadily in the face, as he
asked:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, do I understand you to say you
have the orders of the King&mdash;the King, mind you&mdash;for
your action?”</p>

<p>But Richelieu was not to be browbeaten. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>cocked his hat fiercely on the side of his head,
and answered with a haughtiness equal to that
of the Count:</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Sancerre! It is sufficient for me
that I have my orders. It is my duty to see
them carried out, and yours, monsieur, not to
hinder me.”</p>

<p>“Precisely! Provided you have orders.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!”</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur! There must be some mistake.
One does not arrest gentlemen who have
but a moment ago received the King’s pardon.
If you have the King’s warrant, produce it, and
the matter is ended.”</p>

<p>Sancerre’s words had their effect on the man.
He had started perceptibly at the mention of the
King’s pardon, and for a moment he was shaken.
But Richelieu was a hardy villain, and steeled
himself. He turned insolently from Sancerre, saying:</p>

<p>“I cannot stand here talking all night. Messieurs,
your swords&mdash;or must I use force?”</p>

<p>But here Cipierre’s patience was exhausted.
“Stay!” he cried. “I give you my word, monsieur,
that if you do not produce your authority,
and if you arrest these gentlemen by force without
producing it, that I, Philibert de Marcilly,
Captain of Orleans and Colonel-General of Cavalry,
will break you like a reed. There is an old
story, monsieur, of an earthen vessel and a metal
pot going together down stream&mdash;you have worn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>the black robe, and ought to know the fable&mdash;and
I take it you are wise enough to apply it.
Come, sir, no more fencing; your authority.”</p>

<p>There was a ring in the Vicomte’s voice that
showed he meant every word he said. It was
one thing to beard Sancerre, who, highly placed
as he was, held no great office; it was, however,
quite another thing to cross Cipierre, whose
power as Governor of Orleans, and as a general
of cavalry, was sufficient to crush a man like
Richelieu easily. He felt, too, that every moment
he delayed weakened the ground under his feet,
and made our belief that he held no warrant for
the arrest a certainty. As a matter of fact, he
had not, and confessed it the next moment.</p>

<p>“I have not the warrant with me,” he said,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Whose was the order, then&mdash;the King’s, the
Chancellor’s?”</p>

<p>“My instructions were from the Cardinal,” and
then, recovering his spirit, “and they are enough
for me.”</p>

<p>Cipierre laughed harshly. “So, monsieur, your
orders came from the Cardinal, and they are
enough for you, are they? Since when did Charles
of Lorraine become Colonel of Carabiniers? Or
is it that you think you wear the iron and yellow
of Guise, instead of the silver and red of the King’s
House? Come, Sancerre, end this farce&mdash;show him
the signet and let him be gone.”</p>

<p>Richelieu had paled to the lips with anger as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>Cipierre spoke; but prudence, and perhaps fear,
kept him still&mdash;and now his eyes were fixed on
the signet that Sancerre held toward him.</p>

<p>“It is the King’s,” he said, in a voice thick with
rage.</p>

<p>“And you obey that, or do you refuse? If you
refuse, I will order your own men to arrest you,”
said the Vicomte.</p>

<p>“I have no option but to obey.”</p>

<p>“Very well! Call off your guard from the door!
And to-morrow the King will know what a servant
he has in you.”</p>

<p>Richelieu was no coward, and the stinging
words of Cipierre’s voice raised the man to fury.
He put his hand to the hilt of his sword, and
then, recollecting himself, withdrew it slowly;
but it was in a voice that trembled with passion
that he answered:</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte, I obey the King’s signet.
These gentlemen are free. But you, monsieur&mdash;I
have a word with you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tush, man!” and Cipierre broke in roughly
upon his speech. “You think you are in a tavern.
I cannot cross swords with you. The difference
between us is too great. Come! Call off your
guards!”</p>

<p>And Richelieu did as he was bidden without
another word. In passing out, however, I had
my opportunity. “Monsieur,” I said, “I shall be
pleased to hear the word you intended for Monsieur
le Vicomte.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>A dark flush came on his face. “In another
place,” he answered.</p>

<p>“In your own place, and at your own time,
monsieur. I commend myself to you,” and with
a slight bow we separated.</p>

<p>“They will do their utmost to get the pardon
recalled to-morrow,” said Marcilly, as we trotted
down the silent square of Ste. Croix.</p>

<p>“Remember, however,” I said, “that I am under
the protection of Monsieur of Arles. He wants
me as a free agent, as he said. I fear little for
myself for the next few days.”</p>

<p>“I will be with the Queen-Mother at her rising,”
said Sancerre, “and you, gentlemen, must see the
Prince early to-morrow and arrange all. There
must be no delays now. In case of accidents,
you had better keep this signet for the present,”
and he handed the ring to Marcilly.</p>

<p>We left Sancerre at his house, and, the hour being
late, pushed on at a round pace homeward.
In a few minutes we were again in the Martroi,
now to all appearance totally deserted, except
by the watchmen keeping guard over the scaffoldings
and wooden galleries that filled the
square. Here and there they had lit fires, and
were huddled around them, for the winter wind
blew chill, though the night was clear as crystal
and the moon was out.</p>

<p>On the far side of the square, behind the huge
scaffoldings, which almost hid the houses beyond
them from view, there seemed to be a wakeful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>and merry party around the night fire, which
splattered up redly there, casting its light on the
tracery of the crossed beams and network of galleries
above it. Some one was singing, but we
could not catch the words of the song, though
the chorus came to us distinctly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bon jour! Ma Margoton!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bon jour! Belle mignonne!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cheery refrain jarred on our ears, coming
as it did from almost under the spot where Condé
was to die&mdash;where, if the plans of the Guise succeeded,
not only would Condé die, but with him,
as we thought, our France&mdash;the France that we
loved so well.</p>

<p>We were now almost opposite Cipierre’s house,
where the wooden galleries in the square were
but partly finished. It was here, as we slackened
pace to approach the gates, that we saw a man,
mounted on a white horse, emerge from the shadow
of the scaffolding and come half out into
the moonlight.</p>

<p>Something in his air and manner made me feel
that I knew him, and then a small, dark figure
slipped from the saddle behind him and ran toward
us. It was Majolais, as I live!</p>

<p>“<i>Blitzen!</i>” swore one of the reiters, as he drew
his sword and attempted to make a cut at the
dwarf; but I struck the blade up, saying:</p>

<p>“A friend! A friend! Here, Majolais!”</p>

<p>The next moment the imp was at my side, and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>thrusting a packet into my hand, was off again
like a flash.</p>

<p>“Stay! Stay!” called out both Cipierre and
Marcilly, but the dwarf only laughed&mdash;that cackling,
tongueless laugh of his&mdash;and sprang behind
the saddle of the white horse, while its rider,
turning its head on the instant, went off at a
gallop.</p>

<p>“Come back!” shouted Cipierre, and an answer
came to us through the moonlight:</p>

<p>“<i>Bon coq, Coqueville!</i>” And then we heard him
going ding-dong down the deserted streets.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="smaller">“LE PETIT HOMME TANT JOLI”</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o</span> taken aback were we that for a breath we
did not realize who it was. We heard the reckless
cry riding back to us through the shivering
winter moonlight, we heard the excited “<i>hou!
hou!</i>” of the alarmed watch, and the clatter of
iron-shod hoofs, that stilled suddenly as the rider
turned into a side street that shut out all sound,
and then, only then, did the understanding of the
thing come to us, and Marcilly almost shouted
out:</p>

<p>“By all the saints! ’Tis Coqueville! What blind
folly!” and, with an oath, he struck his gloved
hand on the flap of his holster.</p>

<p>“Perhaps this explains things,” and I held up
at arm’s height the letter Majolais had given to
me, while Cipierre cut in:</p>

<p>“Come, then, let us read it. We have no time
to waste.”</p>

<p>A moment after we were in the hall of Cipierre’s
house, grouped around the letter, which I had
handed to Marcilly, while a tall Swiss held a
lighted candle so that we could read.</p>

<p>“From the Princess,” said Jean, cutting the
yellow seals with the point of his dagger, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>we bent over and read with him. It was from
madame herself, explaining her change of plan,
and stating that she, with a small suite, were
at the moment lying in safe concealment in the
deserted château of St. Loup. She went on to
say it was here her husband was to be brought,
and that she had horses provided to take the
Prince, not to Poitou, but to her uncle, the Constable.</p>

<p>“Montmorenci,” said Cipierre; “that is not so
bad. He is closer than Coligny.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is something in this, especially as
from what passed to-day between Sancerre and
the Queen-Mother, I gather that the old fox is
leaving his earth,” I said, and added, “but does
not madame say anything of this?”</p>

<p>“Not a word! Stay! You are right,” and
Marcilly turned over the page. “It’s here in the
postscript. The Constable has moved from Yvoy
le Marron. If this is true, ’tis only a five-league
ride to reach him, if we could but effect the escape
the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Ponthieu!” I burst out.</p>

<p>“Ponthieu! Eh! What do you mean?” asked
Cipierre.</p>

<p>“That the Constable would never have moved
but for a gallant gentleman of Gascony, one Perducas
de Ponthieu, who risked his life ten times
over for the Cause&mdash;but the story is a long one,
monsieur, and it grows late.”</p>

<p>As I spoke, the huge clock in the hall struck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>midnight, and the bronze bell in the courtyard
clanged out a hoarse echo of the hour.</p>

<p>“Ste. Croix! I did not believe we were so far
into to-morrow,” said Cipierre; “it is, indeed, too
late for further talk, gentlemen, and you need
rest.”</p>

<p>He spoke truly enough, for even Marcilly, despite
his iron endurance, looked pale and worn,
and I&mdash;I was longing to be alone.</p>

<p>And at last I had my desire, and regretted it
the instant it came. In the excitement of passing
events I was taken out of myself; but here, in
this huge bedroom, where the candles seemed but
to make little circles of light, where the logs
burned low on the hearth, where thoughts black
as the shadows that flitted in the uneasy light
over the heavy curtains of the bed, and thick
tapestries on the walls, crowded round me, I
dreaded my loneliness. For a moment I thought
of seeking Badehorn to discuss with him arrangements
for the morrow, and then I laughed at my
weakness, and, undressing, flung myself into a
large easy-chair by the fire, for I felt it was useless
trying to sleep. My body was wearied, it
is true, but my brain was working like a clock&mdash;it
was the old story, that mania which I had
fought so long, and thought defeated, come back
again stronger, more insistent than ever.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I think of this period of my
life, I try to delude myself into the belief that I
was mad then; that it was not I, Gaspard de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>Vibrac, who walked the earth, but a fiend that
had ousted my soul from its earthly tenement&mdash;else
why was this hateful consciousness of a
double presence within me? What was this impalpable,
but resistless power, that was able to
force me, despite my struggles, to follow its malign
course?</p>

<p>But let this rest! Mad or sane, I have to answer
for my past, and the scroll, with its damning
record, is running red before my eyes as I
write; but then, as I sat there, the things that
were to come, the things that were to be of my
own doing, seemed to quiver like uneasy phantoms
before me, and to finally resolve themselves
into the one devilish thing that made me what
I am.</p>

<p>Listen! I had sought to injure Marcilly, therefore
I hated him. I had lowered myself to play
the traitor to him in all that man holds dearest.
But that he stood between me and my love,
this would not have been, and I hated him the
more for that. I had tried to win my way back
to honor, and all but succeeded, when, but a few
hours ago, I found, as I thought&mdash;I jumped to
conclusions as usual&mdash;that I had been made the
victim of a coquette’s pastime. All my vanity,
all my self-love, was wounded and in arms&mdash;I
was filled with the rage that burns in a heart
in which love is turned to anger. I was capable
of anything, and I had paved the way for this
total descent. It was no case&mdash;it never is&mdash;of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>one becoming at once supremely vile. I would
have revenge, a full and complete revenge, for my
abasement, and then came the whispered temptation
that lost me my soul.</p>

<p>I started as the thought came to me, and then
with it came a horror and loathing of the evil
thing. I sprang from my chair and paced the
room. It could not be. It was impossible. I
looked around me like a guilty man, and then I
clutched at a straw. I tried to pray, but my
heart would not feel the words that my cold lips
uttered, and for the first time I rose to my feet,
without even that momentary strength that
prayer had hitherto given me. As I glanced
around me, I saw what I had not noticed before&mdash;a
flagon of wine, and near it a cup, left
there by the thoughtful care of Cipierre’s servants.
Three times did I fill the cup to the brim
and drain it. I wanted sleep, rest, forgetfulness&mdash;if
it was but for a moment. I wanted to become
oblivious of the new horror that had come
upon me, to obtain in the Lethe of sleep that
peace which cannot come even to those who die.
For death is but the door which opens to lead
us into another life. We know not if it brings
rest, we know not if we leave behind us anything
except the earthly shell of the soul. But
sleep&mdash;there is rest in it&mdash;if only for a little while.
And for a space it came to me, a deep and dreamless
slumber, and when I awoke the morning was
well advanced. I made my toilet, and looked out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>of the lattice window. The day was one in which
sunlight and mist strove with each other, and the
sun was winning, aided by a breeze, which shred
the clouds into woolly wisps, that floated westward
in long lines, with patches of blue sky between
them.</p>

<p>The rest had done me good. I held my hand
to the light, and it was steady, not trembling
like an aspen leaf, as it was when I lay down to
sleep; but the evil thing in my mind was still
there, and, strange to say, I no longer looked at it
with the horror and loathing of a few hours back.</p>

<p>As I turned from the window there was a
knock at the door, and I heard Marcilly’s voice
asking if he could come in.</p>

<p>“Come in!” I answered back, and my voice was
gay and cordial, for a traitor must know to be
a hypocrite.</p>

<p>Jean entered, looking refreshed and strong again,
his slight, spare figure set off to advantage in the
rich brown and yellow of his dress, while a short
cloak of the same colors, fastened at the throat
by a jewelled clasp, was hung carelessly over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Is it time to be moving?” I asked as he came
in, adding, “I fear I have slept late.”</p>

<p>“There is time yet, Vibrac,” he answered, seating
himself in the arm-chair and playing with
his gloves. There was something on his mind,
something he desired to say; but I would not
help him, and at last he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Gaspard,” he said, “there is a thing I want
you to do for me.”</p>

<p>I remained silent, our eyes met for a moment,
and then he went on, his voice shaking a little:
“I must not see Marie again. The sight of her
unmans me. I want you, however, to do this
for me”&mdash;he pulled from his breast pocket a letter,
which he held in his hand&mdash;“I want you to
give this to Marie. It is my farewell,” and he
laughed, a mirthless, nervous laugh.</p>

<p>“Give it to me!” I replied, stretching out my
hand; “it will reach madame’s hands in safety.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” and as he handed me the letter
a thought struck me, and it was merely to make
conversation that I gave utterance to it, little
imagining to what it would lead.</p>

<p>“Has it never occurred to you, Marcilly, that
your wife is in very great danger here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t follow,” he answered, though he paled
a little.</p>

<p>“Merely this&mdash;that if there is any hitch in our
attempt, to save herself Catherine will sacrifice
every one to the Guise. I doubt if any mercy
will be shown to any one belonging to you&mdash;and
you remember, too, that the St. Andre, and
Achon above all, claim your wife’s estates of
Chaumont.”</p>

<p>“They would never dare,” he said, but I interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“The estates are large, I believe, and you recollect
the case of Mademoiselle de Luynes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>He leaned back helplessly in his chair, biting
his lip, and twisting at his moustache, and as I
looked at him, tossed with mental agony, and
thought, too, of the hideous story of which I
had just reminded him, my good angel made a
last effort, and touched me with pity. I went up
to him, and put my hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“See, Marcilly!” I said. “You want a cool
brain and a steady nerve for this, and that you
will never have as long as your wife is here.
Why not get her away? Let her join the Princess
at St. Loup at once, and thence go on with
her to her refuge with the Constable.”</p>

<p>His face brightened at once. “If that could
be done! But Catherine will never let her
go.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” I said. “I will manage
that. What is more natural than that madame
should come to Cipierre’s house to see you? She
has been here constantly before, and her coming
will arouse no suspicion. From the Martroi to
St. Loup is scarce two hours’ ride, and she would
be with the Princess before any one even began
to suspect that the bird had flown.”</p>

<p>He sprang up and wrung my hand.</p>

<p>“Do this,” he said, “and you will loose a mill-stone
from my neck.”</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy; and is it not time to
start?”</p>

<p>“In a half-hour,” he said, “when we have breakfasted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Punctually to the half-hour we started. Cipierre
had already gone on to the palace, but
four of his Swiss troopers came with us, and,
confident in the King’s pardon, and in the protection
afforded by an escort wearing the colors
of the Captain of Orleans, we had no fear of meeting
any one, not even the Guise himself.</p>

<p>We rode slowly up the crowded Rue Royale,
talking gaily of a hundred things, to cover that
which was in our minds. We spoke of Coqueville
and wondered if he had got free of the town. It
was all but impossible, as we thought, and if
arrested, we knew there would be no mercy shown
to him, who, with the exception perhaps of Renaudie,
had been perhaps the most daring and
able leader of the Amboisards. And even as we
spoke of him the old proverb came true, for in
the pushing, swaying crowd in the street I caught
a glimpse of the dwarf, his gay clothes covered
with patches of mud, as if he had fallen heavily,
and close to him was Coqueville himself, stalking
quietly through the press, evidently making
his way toward the city gates.</p>

<p>“See there!” I whispered to Marcilly, but his
eye was as quick as mine.</p>

<p>“So they have not got off. They are lost if
they are recognized now&mdash;take no notice.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the dwarf turned his head and
saw us, showing his teeth in a knowing smile,
while he plucked Coqueville by his cloak, but
the latter looked at us as if we were perfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>strangers, and began to cross the road slowly,
followed by his companion.</p>

<p>It was at this point that a party of horsemen
came sharply into the street. They rode at a trot,
utterly regardless of the people, and the crowd
gave before them in fear.</p>

<p>It was Achon himself who rode at the head of
these men&mdash;Achon booted and spurred like a carabinier
of the guard, a steel corselet glinting under
his purple mantle, and swinging in his right hand
a long, straight cutting whip. In the stir caused
by the pace at which Monsieur of Arles and his
men came on, Coqueville slipped out of sight,
but, confused by the crowd, Majolais hesitated
and looked around him. Achon’s horse swerved
slightly at the black, misshapen figure; but, pulling
him back almost on his haunches, the prelate
raised his whip and struck the Moor savagely
across the face. For a moment, half blinded and
bleeding, Majolais staggered back and then sprang
at Achon, something flashing brightly in his hand;
but the cruel whip came down again like lightning,
and, with a shriek, the dwarf rolled over
on the cobble-stones of the pavement. A man-at-arms
lowered his lance to stick him, but the
dwarf gained his feet with incredible rapidity,
and dashed headlong into the crowd, which closed
around him with a roar of oaths, laughter, and
mob-cries, with now and then a tone that rose
to the octave of menace against the bishop and
his suite. But Achon only smiled grimly as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>gave some orders to his followers, and two of
them detached themselves, as if to pursue the
dwarf, while the rest rode onward.</p>

<p>Not once had Achon looked in our direction,
and yet I knew and felt that we had been seen
and recognized by him, though for the present
that mattered little. He was evidently on his
way to the palace, and we halted for a moment
to let the crowd clear, and watched the cavalcade,
until it turned off to the right, and vanished
from our view.</p>

<p>“If the dwarf lives through this, ’twill go hard
with Achon,” said Marcilly.</p>

<p>“If he lives!” I answered; “hark at the crowd
roaring after him.”</p>

<p>And from the distance we could hear the yells
of the mob, as fickle as the breeze, now joined in
hounding down the dwarf, whom but a moment
before they had closed round in protection.</p>

<p>“They’ll have him to a certainty!” said Marcilly.
“I would we could have saved him.”</p>

<p>I said nothing. There was nothing to say. It
would have been madness to have drawn swords
then with the enterprise we had in hand. We
could not deviate from our course, but I was not
satisfied with myself, and rode in silence, until
we saw the Emperor’s Pistols, grinning over the
gateway of the house in the Rue Parisis, and
drew rein before the prison of Condé.</p>

<p>An archer guard was at the gate, and a little
way from the men Monsieur de Bresy, the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>gentleman who had destroyed my house in Paris
a year back, and who was now in charge of the
Prince, stood patting the neck of a gray horse
from which he had just dismounted. He flung
the reins to a groom and turned to us.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, gentlemen! I address Messieurs
de Marcilly and de Vibrac, do I not?”</p>

<p>“The same, monsieur,” and we bowed our greeting
as we dismounted.</p>

<p>“I was at the palace last night and saw you,
as well as heard your names there,” said de
Bresy, as if in explanation of his recognition of
us. And then he added: “I fear, M. de Vibrac,
you owe me no good will for what happened in
Paris. I give you my word, however, that I
could not restrain the men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is quite possible,” I answered, and then,
checking myself, for it was no time to quarrel, I
went on: “We have made our peace at last. We
have come here, however, to pay our respects to
His Highness.”</p>

<p>“Had you come an hour ago it would have
been useless, but as it is I shall inquire if the
Prince will receive you. I was sent for to the
palace this morning, and informed that the Prince
would be allowed henceforth to see a few friends
daily&mdash;you are, I presume, of the number?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, and if there is any doubt on the
matter, perhaps this will satisfy you,” and Marcilly
held out the signet.</p>

<p>De Bresy glanced at it for a moment without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>showing any surprise: “It is more than enough,”
he said, and then as he looked again at Marcilly:
“But for the weather that has touched
your cheek, monsieur, and that you do not stoop
so much, ’twould be hard to distinguish you from
Condé.”</p>

<p>We laughed, and I put my hand on Jean’s
shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>“You see here, monsieur, ‘The Shadow of
Condé.’”</p>

<p>“I shall take care,” was the reply, “that I do
not mistake the shadow for the substance; will
you enter, gentlemen?” and with these words he
motioned us into the doorway, now opened by
the guard.</p>

<p>In the courtyard we were stopped for a few
seconds, and de Bresy went off to announce our
coming. When he went out of earshot, I remarked:</p>

<p>“Did you hear what de Bresy said&mdash;that he
would take care not to mistake the shadow for
the substance? Think you he suspects?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to say. You must keep him
engaged the whole time when the stroke comes
off to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not to-day?”</p>

<p>“If it can be done to-day, I’ll risk it; but there
may be suspicions, and ’twould be well to let
them sleep.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” I said, “that as soon as ever
matters have been explained to the Prince I leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>you. I have to do that ride to St. Loup to-day.”</p>

<p>“You are the best of friends,” he answered.
“But hush! Here comes de Bresy.”</p>

<p>In effect de Bresy appeared at the moment.
“His Highness will receive you, gentlemen&mdash;have
the kindness to follow me,” and he led the way.
We observed everything that was possible as we
went, noted the number of sentries in the corridors,
counted the steps on the stairs, marked the
thickness of the doors and how they were secured,
until at last we reached a landing, where
there was an officer and four men on guard.
Behind them was an open door, and, looking into
the room beyond, we saw three or four figures
seated round a card table, early in the day though
it was. They were the Prince and his immediate
attendants, Vaux and one or two others. Condé
saw us almost at once, and, in cheery greeting,
waved a hand holding some cards, his voice as
joyous and hearty as if he had never known a
moment’s grief, as if he did not know that within
a few hours his neck might lie upon the headsman’s
block. He was a true Bourbon, and the
Bourbons, with all their faults, were never afflicted
with the poltroon fever.</p>

<p>“Welcome!” he cried. “Come, give me all the
news.” And, flinging his cards on the table, he
rose and took us by the hands. Except that he
was pale and thin with his confinement, he seemed
as much at his ease there, with death hanging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>over him, as if he were receiving us in his own
château of Germiny.</p>

<p>We met him in the same spirit, and spoke in
general terms of a hundred things, de Bresy,
who remained in the room, joining in the converse.
At last I caught Marcilly’s eye, and succeeded
in arresting de Bresy’s attention for a
moment by raising a discussion on Touchet’s
system of fence. I showed him the Spanish pass,
and, when the little play was over, had the satisfaction
of seeing that Jean had been able to
make known at least the object of our coming.</p>

<p>As I sheathed my sword the Prince said, “Bresy,
these gentlemen dine with me to-day; I trust you
will honor me with your company as well.”</p>

<p>The archer bowed and expressed his thanks,
and, seeing that we were staying practically for
the day, begged leave to excuse himself, as he had
to do his rounds. As he was at the door Condé
called after him:</p>

<p>“At twelve exactly, de Bresy, and we will play
a match at tennis in the afternoon. I wager ten
écus that Marcilly, here, beats you. Will you take
it?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, monseigneur,” and, bowing, de
Bresy went.</p>

<p>The door was still open, but that did not matter,
for we gathered round the card table, which
we pushed near the fireplace, and as we pretended
to play, Marcilly, in a few rapid words,
explained our plan. It was only, however, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>we came to the point that the Princess was awaiting
him at St. Loup that Condé spoke.</p>

<p>“<i>Oui-da!</i>” he exclaimed. “I would ’twere La
Limeuil.”</p>

<p>Marcilly bit his lip, and I for one did not hesitate
to show my feelings. The callous indifference
displayed by the man we were about to risk
so much for moved me for the moment to hot
anger. I actually dared to curse him in my heart,
I, who in a short time was to be guilty of a
crime to which the Bourbon’s sins were white
as snow. Condé, however, was quick to see the
effect of his words. He laughed his merry laugh.
“Ah!” he said, “I but jested, my friends. Once
out of this”&mdash;and his eye flashed&mdash;“I will draw
the sword openly, and, by God’s grace, France
shall be free.”</p>

<p>The matter passed off, and Marcilly went on,
explaining his plan to the end. When he had finished,
Condé, who had said no word since that
untoward interruption of his, leaned back in his
chair, tugging at his moustache. We had expected
him to say something, but not a word did he
utter, not even a phrase that was suggestive of
thanks for the sacrifice that was being made;
and at last it was with a voice that almost
trembled with anger that I asked:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur approves of the plan, I trust?”</p>

<p>“It is impracticable,” he said shortly. “Come,
let us go on with the cards.”</p>

<p>We looked at one another in astonishment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>“Does not Your Highness intend to make any
effort?” I went on. “And how is this impracticable?
We at least deserve to be told that.”</p>

<p>He had picked up an ace of hearts, and was
looking at it as I spoke. When I finished, he laid
it down face upward on the table, and looked
at us.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” he said gravely, “it is impracticable
because, for such a plan to succeed, Louis
of Bourbon must be base enough to buy his life
at the expense of another’s&mdash;and&mdash;he has not yet
come to that. Messieurs, if this were the only
way, and I had to die ten times over, I would
not take it. Let there be an end to this. Your
very offer is an insult to me.”</p>

<p>To say that we were thunderstruck is nothing.
Here was an aspect of the case that had never
presented itself to us. We looked at each other
blankly, and as we looked the gong in the courtyard
struck the half-hour after eleven.</p>

<p>There are moments when a lie becomes almost
sublime, and one of those moments had come.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” said Marcilly, “you are under
a misapprehension. My safety is assured in any
case&mdash;it is pledged.”</p>

<p>I turned to him; but the expression on his face
stilled the inquiry on my lips, and I waited and
wondered, while the Prince said dryly, with that
touch of sarcasm in his words, from which he
could never divest himself:</p>

<p>“Indeed! By the King himself, perhaps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Monseigneur can judge for himself,” and Jean
held out the signet of the King.</p>

<p>Condé took it in his hand for a moment, and
his glance shot out at Marcilly like a sword blade,
but the features of the other remained immovable
and calm.</p>

<p>“I believe you, monsieur,” he said, as he handed
back the signet, “and I place myself in your hands.
Forgive me the words I have just spoken.”</p>

<p>For a moment I, Gaspard de Vibrac, had
thought that my vengeance on that heartless
coquette was about to escape me.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>hat</span>! Do you not stay for dinner?”</p>

<p>It was de Bresy who spoke as I was
mounting my horse. He was leaning over the
parapet that crowned the gateway, and looking
down at me with a curious, suspicious glance in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“No!” I answered carelessly, as I gained the
saddle. “I am due at the palace this afternoon,
and have made my excuse to His Highness. By
the way, you have later news than I, monsieur&mdash;does
the King’s improvement continue?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “’Tis said he had
a good night.”</p>

<p>“May it lead to many better! <i>Au revoir!</i> I
trust you will win your match at tennis.”</p>

<p>“Would you care to lay anything on Marcilly?”
asked de Bresy, with a gambler’s eagerness for a
wager, and I humored him.</p>

<p>“Another ten to the Prince’s, if you like,” and
I steadied my fretting nag.</p>

<p>“Done with you!” he replied, and so wishing
him the day once more, and taking one of the
Swiss with me, I trotted off, outwardly calm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>but inwardly a prey to a hundred conflicting
emotions.</p>

<p>I had just left two men, one of whom had done
a generous thing, while the other had performed
a great and noble action. In realizing that in
this they had gone far beyond me, so strangely
was I constituted that I felt a jealous anger at
the thought of their nobleness. In soul I had already
sunk so low, that I began to hate anything
that was good, or rather to think that I
hated it, and this, in effect, is the same thing.
Yet, with all this, I saw my own fault. I felt
that I was wrong, and almost despised myself.
Even then I had a chance&mdash;up to the last moment
I might have saved myself, but for that
mad longing for revenge on the woman whom I
accused in my heart of having brought me to this
level. There are those who will say I was beside
myself; that no one, short of an idiot and a
fool, could have jumped to the conclusions I had
done; that the thing was, and is, impossible.
My answer is, that it was just because I was beside
myself, it was just because I was blind and
frenzied with my own passions, that I did what
I did, and I may add that, in my opinion, all
such crimes as mine are due to the same cause,
to the temporary mental paralysis that makes
one unable to follow the right path. It is only
necessary to look around, and a hundred such
instances may be seen&mdash;none, perhaps, so black
and damning as mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>With these conflicting emotions in my mind, I
was going across the square of Ste. Croix, when
I once again met Achon and his suite. They were
evidently returning from the palace, when we
crossed each other, coming almost face to face,
and this time Achon greeted me, saying as he
did so:</p>

<p>“Monsieur! A word with you, with your permission.”</p>

<p>“It cannot, I imagine, be to seek alms for the
poor,” I answered with a sneer&mdash;I wished the
man to know that I was aware of the part he
had played in Rue des Lavandières. But his face
remained immovable, as he looked at me coldly,
saying:</p>

<p>“It was not only to seek alms that I was in
the Rue des Lavandières&mdash;there were other things
I wanted&mdash;some I got&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stole, rather! That list of names! Those&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Letters,” he interrupted, still with that cold
smile on his face. “They were even more interesting
than the scroll. Bah! Monsieur de Vibrac!
I thought better of you. I little imagined you
could be the plaything of a coquette!”</p>

<p>I winced at the words, and he went on: “Such
women as that take the soul out of a man. They
should be destroyed like vampires.”</p>

<p>“Is this all you have to say?” I asked unsteadily
as we rode side by side slowly down the Rue
Jeanne d’Arc.</p>

<p>“No, monsieur; events are moving more rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
than I thought, and it becomes necessary
for us to move with them.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” I replied. “I see not how the matter
concerns me.”</p>

<p>“Is your memory defective?” he asked, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it is peculiarly retentive.”
There was something in my voice, low as it was,
something in the words, that had a convincing
effect, and Achon appreciated the position. His
tone and manner changed on the instant, and it
was with a cat-like, caressing purr that he said:</p>

<p>“Your pardon, de Vibrac! The old Adam comes
out in me too often, I fear, long and painfully
though I have borne the cross&mdash;&mdash;” But, still
hot with resentment and the thoughts he had
inspired, I interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I am pressed for time.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” with a quick, almost imperceptible
change to his former manner. “You have
not forgotten our little agreement.”</p>

<p>“I have already said that my memory is retentive.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You men of war are like flint and steel.”
The shadow of a smile flickered over his thin,
red lips. “I but recalled you to that promise,
monsieur, because I would like it fulfilled to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A few hours sooner or later can matter
little to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Not a rush! When and where?”</p>

<p>“An hour after compline, in the priory of the
Jacobins. You know it?”</p>

<p>“There will be no difficulty in finding it out.”</p>

<p>“And you will come?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered slowly, and then leaning forward,
he touched me slightly on the arm.</p>

<p>“I will return you those letters there if you do
what I want. They are useless to me&mdash;but to
you&mdash;&mdash;” And he simply looked at me, the unspoken
sentence in his eyes.</p>

<p>I felt my heart beat at his words, but said
nothing; and Achon continued:</p>

<p>“You will be punctual, monsieur&mdash;a good day!”</p>

<p>And this strange man rode on, leaving me a
prey to a hundred emotions. For a moment I
held my horse reined in, and then, turning, rode
on toward the palace.</p>

<p>On entering the gates I found the courtyard
crowded, and there was evidently an unwonted
commotion; but I stopped to make no inquiry,
and, dismounting from my horse, gave the trooper
the reins, and walked up the steps, feeling with
my hand at my breast-pocket to discover if the
letter Marcilly had given me was safe. It was
there; but the touch seemed to burn me, and,
dropping my hand, I joined the throng at the
main entrance.</p>

<p>So great was the crush that at first I could
make no way; and, leaning against a pillar,
cast about to see if there was any one I knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>who would conduct me to Madame de Marcilly.
Not a face could I recognize, until at last I saw
Lorgnac a few yards from me. As often happens
in a crowd, I had looked at the spot where he
was ten times before without noticing him, and
then his face flashed upon me as if he had sprung
from nowhere. He caught my eye as I looked,
nodded and smiled, and finally I edged myself
to his side, and we exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>“There is something more than usual going on
to-day, is there not?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I believe news has come that has fluttered the
dovecotes here a little. All sorts of rumors are
afloat. They say that Coligny and the Huguenots
are in arms, and that the Constable, with
ten thousand men, is marching to cut off our retreat
to Paris.”</p>

<p>“Ha! The usual stories when no one knows
anything, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, there is something afoot&mdash;and
Richelieu swears they mean to hasten the execution
of the Prince.”</p>

<p>“Richelieu! He would be likely to know.”</p>

<p>“Probably, but I never trust Richelieu. He appears
to have fallen into some sort of disgrace
since last evening, for de Baillieul is on guard at
the council chamber, and I know that he was
refused an audience by the Queen-Mother this
morning.”</p>

<p>“I could explain that, I think, were there time;
but, monsieur, I have a favor to ask. I have an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>important letter to deliver to Madame de Marcilly.
Can you tell me where I could find her?”</p>

<p>He laughed a little as he answered: “I’m afraid
I’m not much of a squire of dames, and hardly
ever know the order of the day for the ladies-in-waiting.
Madame is probably with the Queen-Mother,
or perhaps in the gallery overlooking
what we call the Queen’s Terrace.”</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” I exclaimed, with an affectation of
cheerfulness, “I know no more of this place than
if I were a blind man in a labyrinth. How am
I to find her?”</p>

<p>“I’ll guide you as far as I am able,” he said
good-naturedly, and, thanking Lorgnac, I followed
him as he made his way slowly through
the crowd, and eventually into the corridor
through which we had passed the night before,
when seeking Catherine’s cabinet.</p>

<p>When about the middle of the corridor Lorgnac
stopped before a door.</p>

<p>“This will take you into the gallery,” he said.
“You will find little Crequi in waiting at the
other end, and he will tell you more than I can.
I never venture there, so now say <i>au revoir</i>!”</p>

<p>With a word or so of thanks for his kindness,
I put my hand to the door, and, passing through
it, found myself in the gallery. It stretched along
a wing of the palace overlooking a terrace laid
out as a garden, which hung over the cloisters
of the courtyard beneath. I had scarce taken
ten steps when a little burst of laughter came up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>to me from the terrace, and with it my own
name pronounced in a woman’s voice. Glancing
out through the window, I saw, seated on a rustic
bench immediately beneath me, two ladies,
wrapped in long cloaks, for the day was cold.
The one was La Limeuil, the other the woman
over whom my life was wrecked. I stood for a
moment watching them&mdash;it was only on one of
them that my eyes were fixed, and as I looked
on those clear-cut, delicate features, and the limpid
blue eyes, and the rippling flaxen curls that escaped
from her silken hood, all the love I thought
was gone came back, and I stood there, trembling,
and all but unable to move.</p>

<p>That face could never have played the traitor!
No! I had misjudged it. I was wrong, a hundred
times wrong. It was not for me to bring
sorrow to those eyes, so honest and true&mdash;I who
had escaped but by a hand’s breadth from shadowing
them with eternal sorrow. In that moment
I forgot my vengeance, forgot all. I was
only conscious of the fact that I was near her.
I rested my hand on the marble balustrade and
looked. I would draw back. I would hold fast
by the vows I had sworn to myself on that night
when I spurred from the gates of Paris, leaving,
as I thought, my sin behind me; and even as my
mind worked so, the other woman, Isabel de
Limeuil, spoke, and speech and answer struck
me like a blow on the face.</p>

<p>“As I was saying, I saw him, your old friend,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>de Vibrac. Is it true that he weds Favras’ daughter,
that little Yvonne de Mailly?”</p>

<p>Marie de Marcilly opened and shut the gold
stopper of her vinaigrette as she answered: “I
neither know nor care. Monsieur de Vibrac’s
affairs do not interest me in the least.”</p>

<p>But the other was not to be denied, and with
the feline cruelty of her sex she thrust in a pin.</p>

<p>“He adored you once&mdash;did he not?”</p>

<p>Marie laughed. “Whoever can remember a year
back? The trifling of an hour passes with the
hour, and one forgets it with one’s old gloves or
a worn-out mask.”</p>

<p>I caught my breath. It was true then! Achon’s
words&mdash;the thoughts that had come to me last
night&mdash;were they not true&mdash;proved to the very
hilt? But I would have measure for measure,
and, waiting to hear no more, I drew back, the
hot blood burning within me.</p>

<p>How little did I know that complex thing&mdash;a
woman! I judged her from the standpoint of a
man, forgetting that a woman never speaks out
her whole thoughts, perhaps because she herself
does not know what those thoughts are, perhaps
because by her very nature she can never have
complete self-knowledge, and so remains a sphinx
to man and a mystery to herself.</p>

<p>I walked slowly up the gallery, hurt, wounded,
all the savage in me roused. I had half a mind
to turn on my heel, to see her no more, to give
Marcilly’s letter to the nearest page to deliver to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>her, and to ride back, leaving her to her fate.
When what was to happen was known, the avarice
of Achon, the fears of Catherine, and the ferocity
of the Guise would show no mercy&mdash;and she
deserved none at my hands. Why should I move
a finger to save her, this woman who could kill
a man’s soul? And so, as I brooded, the tempter
to whose counsels I was ever a ready listener
whispered again in my ear, and I almost laughed
as the infernal plan developed before me like lightning.
Yes! There was a sweetness in the thought
of such a vengeance that filled me with an unholy
joy. From that moment I was lost&mdash;I had
come forth from the gates of the temple, and the
doors were shut behind me.</p>

<p>Near the end of the gallery where I had halted
was a stairway leading down to the terrace below.
I made a step toward it, hesitated, and
then boldly descended; as I reached the last step
coming face to face with the two, who had risen
from their seats and were walking along the
terrace.</p>

<p>We bowed to each other formally. Marie did
not give me her hand, though the color left her
cheek, and her companion glanced from one to
another of us with a slightly malicious look, as
if enjoying the situation; but I gave her little for
her satisfaction, for, drawing my letter forth, I
presented it, saying calmly:</p>

<p>“From Monsieur le Comte, madame, and I have
besides a message for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“I thank you, Monsieur de Vibrac,” she answered,
while Mademoiselle de Limeuil, catching
the meaning of my last words, cut in: “It
is my hour for attendance, I believe&mdash;you will excuse
me,” and with a little nod and a smile she
ran up the steps, leaving us together.</p>

<p>Ay! Even as I stood there watching her, the
letter in her hand, and her eyes turned to me
with a mute inquiry in them, I would have spared
her but for the cruel words still ringing in my
ears; and, burning as I was with rage, I was
overawed by her beauty, and stammered as I
went on blundering:</p>

<p>“I should not have come, I know, but Marcilly
himself charged me with this message.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyebrows slightly and laughed.
“I see no reason why you should not have come,
monsieur&mdash;will you permit me?” and she made as
if to open the letter. She was so cool, so calm,
so utterly self possessed, that it brought me to
myself. She had forgotten the old glove&mdash;well,
so could I. The past was dead. I was given to
understand that, in the subtle, indescribable way
that only a woman can, and I took my cue.
Her hand was on the seal to break open the letter
when I arrested her.</p>

<p>“One moment, madame&mdash;perhaps you had better
hear my message before reading the letter.”</p>

<p>“Is it anything serious? Nothing has happened
to Marcilly?” I winced at the eager ring in her
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing has happened, but what I have to
say is serious enough”; and then, as we walked
the length of the terrace and back, I put the matter
to her, talking as if we were but acquaintances;
and as we stood once more at the steps
she said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I will meet you in two hours’ time
on the parvis of St. Pierre.”</p>

<p>“That will do&mdash;but be well mounted, madame&mdash;we
may have to ride.” I bowed as I took my
leave, but this time she extended her hand, and,
touching it with mine, I left her there. As I
walked up the steps I could hear the crackling
of the paper as she tore open the seals of her
letter; but I would not trust myself to look
again. When I had gained the corridor, I could
find no trace of Lorgnac, so, after a glance around,
I strolled leisurely out, and mounting my horse,
rode in the direction of the Martroi, going by the
Escures, so as to pass St. Pierre on the way.</p>

<p>I was still smarting from the effects of the
words I had heard. My mind, unhinged and incapable
of reason, took a sullen pleasure in recalling
them and in anticipating the payment I
would exact for my tortures. Wrapped in these
thoughts, I took no notice of anything around,
and had come opposite St. Pierre without observing
it, when I heard the grating voice of
Richelieu.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac!” and he had steadied his
horse alongside of mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“As you perceive, monsieur,” I answered coldly,
a fierce joy swelling in my heart at the thought
that here was one, at least, upon whom my pent-up
wrath could break.</p>

<p>“You were good enough, monsieur, to observe
last night that you would like to hear a word
from me.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you like,” and I looked him full in
the face.</p>

<p>“Nothing would suit me better but for the
Edict, and there are a dozen or more of Monsieur
de Cipierre’s bees about, who would soon
interrupt us.”</p>

<p>“You would rather not go on then?” I inquired
with a sneer, and his brown cheek flushed.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, but the place is inconvenient.
Would to-night suit you? There is a full
moon.”</p>

<p>“Nothing better; but I must ask you the favor
of making your time fit in with mine, as I have
an engagement to-night.”</p>

<p>“And so have I, but at a somewhat late hour.
Would nine suit you?”</p>

<p>“Excellently, monsieur, and there is good ground
behind Ste. Croix, I believe.”</p>

<p>“I know a better spot&mdash;the garden of the Jacobins.
We shall be safe from interruption there.”</p>

<p>I started slightly at the words, and noticed,
too, that Richelieu observed me, for he looked
at me keenly as I answered:</p>

<p>“As you please, monsieur; but will it not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>necessary to pass through the Priory to get to
the garden?”</p>

<p>“There is a door opposite the inn called the
Red Rabbit; you cannot mistake the sign. Be
there on the stroke to nine, and knock thrice.
It will be opened to you.”</p>

<p>“I shall not fail.”</p>

<p>“And I trust, monsieur, our conversation then
will be agreeable to you.”</p>

<p>“It will be more agreeable than this, I have no
doubt&mdash;your servant, Monsieur de Richelieu.”</p>

<p>We lifted our hats to each other, and parted as
politely as if we were two friends giving each
other the day. As I rode down toward the
Martroi, I could not help wondering to myself
at the strange coincidence, that both Richelieu
and Achon should have chosen the Jacobin priory
for our meeting. There was certainly something
behind this, perhaps treachery to me; but come
what may I was determined to keep my tryst.
I was like a bear that had been baited to fury.
I was strong as a bull, and had had a sword
placed in my hands ere I was ten years of age.
I smiled grimly as I rode under the lions above
Cipierre’s gate, thinking to myself that Richelieu
was likely to find our conversation more interesting
than he imagined.</p>

<p>Once in the house, I made a hasty meal, and
then went to see in what condition my horse
was&mdash;the one I had used this morning having
been borrowed from Cipierre. I found my nag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>looking sleek and fit for work, and, giving orders
to have him saddled in an hour’s time, sought
the great hall and flung myself into a chair near
the fire. Marcilly was with the Prince. Cipierre
was still at the palace, and I was glad of that.
I was disinclined for company. I could not have
borne to speak with any one then; I could not
even think, but sat before the fire nursing my
fury. At last the time came for me to start, and
with a message that I would, perhaps, be late I
rode out, this time alone.</p>

<p>Marie was already before St. Pierre as I came
up. She looked pale and nervous, but her voice
was firm as she replied to my apologies for not
being there to receive her.</p>

<p>“You have not kept me waiting at all; I have
but just come,” and then she went on: “It was
with the greatest difficulty I got away.”</p>

<p>“We had better not delay a moment,” I answered,
and putting our horses to the trot, we
went forward at a rapid pace. Up to the time
we were free of the gates we did not exchange
a word, and the silence continued for a short
time after, as we galloped along the winter road;
but at last we reined in, to give our horses breathing
space, and then she spoke.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” she said, “I feel I ought to thank
you for what you are doing. Believe me, I shall
remember this.”</p>

<p>“As long as an old glove or a worn-out mask,”
I said bitterly, and she flushed scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“You speak in riddles, and I am not good at
guessing.” She swung her jewelled riding-whip
impatiently in her hand, and it was as much
as I could do to restrain myself from telling
her I knew all now, every detail of the treachery
by which she had lured me to love her to
madness, and led me on to make sport for herself
and her companions. But I held myself
in. I could afford to wait, for my time was
coming.</p>

<p>“Your pardon,” I said. “I am afraid the past
year has not improved me. I have changed much
in heart and feelings. I am no longer a boy.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” The whip went up and down again.
She was determined to have no allusion to the
past, and, fool that I was, I was blundering into
it more and more at each moment. “Come, monsieur!”
she went on, “another half-league and we
shall almost be at St. Loup,” and touching her
horse lightly on the shoulder with her whip, she
galloped on, I following at her heels.</p>

<p>We were well in the forest by this, and the
early winter’s night was coming on apace. From
the damp and sodden ground a gray mist had
arisen, and brooded sullenly over the earth.
Through the opal shadows which quivered uneasily
around us, the trees held out dim skeleton
arms, to which here and there clung a few withered
and yellow leaves. But the sky above us
was clear, and augured a fair night, and as I
looked up at it I had a grim satisfaction in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>thinking that there would be no cloud shadows
to spoil the Spanish pass, to which I fully intended
to introduce Monsieur de Richelieu. We
had now slackened pace again almost unconsciously,
and madame asked:</p>

<p>“How far is it now?”</p>

<p>“Not a quarter of a mile,” I said, a little surprised,
because I thought the road was as well
known to her as to me.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, “is not that the château?”
and she pointed with her riding-whip to where a
vast, irregular shadow loomed between the mist
and the trees.</p>

<p>“Yes!” I answered, and at that moment madame’s
whip somehow slipped from her hand and
fell to earth, where it lay with its jewelled head
flashing, for all the world like a snake.</p>

<p>She uttered a little exclamation, and, dismounting,
I picked up the whip and handed it to her,
her gloved fingers touching mine for a moment.
And then, I do not know how it was, but I
stood there by the side of her horse, and she,
playing with the handle of the whip, said in her
low, sweet voice:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I hear that you are to be married.
If it is true, will you permit an old friend to wish
you all happiness?”</p>

<p>The blue eyes looked down upon me kindly;
there was a smile upon the arch of her lips. I
had seen the temptress so before, leading me on,
but though I tried to steel myself my heart began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to beat, and my voice trembled as I answered:</p>

<p>“The story is not true, madame; but I thank
you for your good wishes.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she answered; “I had hoped it
was true.”</p>

<p>The time, the hour, the drawing power in her
glance, was bringing me to her feet again. Could
I not free myself from this Circe who looked so
innocent and pure, and yet could pitilessly destroy?
Was I again to dance for her amusement?
I tried to speak. I meant to say something bitter,
but blundered into a hopeless:</p>

<p>“I shall never marry.”</p>

<p>She smiled now, and even through the mist I
could see the pink on her cheek, as she bent forward
and laid her hand lightly on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, Monsieur de Vibrac. You must get over
this.”</p>

<p>The hand was still on my shoulder. The touch
thrilled through me. I was hardly conscious of
what I said, but I slipped back a year, and
pleaded madly for her love. Only a few words
escaped me; they were enough, however, and she
stopped me, white and trembling.</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” she said, “you are mad! How dare
you!”</p>

<p>“How dare I,” I repeated. And then the memory
of the words I had overheard in the Queen’s
Terrace came back to me, and in unmanly, bitter
anger I cast them up at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>I can see it all now: the red light of sunset
broadening through the mist, the bare tree trunks
burning like copper, the outlines of the château
growing more solid and defined, and the figure
of Marie before me. I had stepped back a pace
as I spoke in my anger, and she had half turned
her horse’s head toward me, listening with blazing
eyes as I finished my cruel speech.</p>

<p>I know now that what she said was to cure
me of my madness. I was fool enough to believe
then every word she spoke in her hot anger.</p>

<p>“So you accuse me of playing with you, monsieur.
You refuse to believe that a woman may
have strength to save herself from being lost.
You cast up in my face what I had buried, what
I hoped had passed from my life forever. Well,
let it be so&mdash;I wanted amusement, and you afforded
it to me. You are right&mdash;I think no more
of you than of an old glove or a worn-out mask.”</p>

<p>With that she turned her horse’s head, and,
striking him smartly with the whip, galloped off
in the direction of St. Loup.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was true then, and my worst suspicions were
confirmed. Out of Marie’s own lips was she
convicted twice over, and had I been struck across
the face with her riding-whip, the sting, the smart,
would have been nothing to the intolerable pain
her words inflicted upon me. I lost all power of
reason. All power of thought left me. For a
space my mind seemed numbed and paralyzed.
I looked dully around on the purple haze, and
the still, silent trees, listening, I know not why,
to the beat of her horse’s hoofs, as the sound
grew fainter and more faint, until at last it died
away in the distance. I might have stood there
for a half-hour, with a mind in which all things
were blurred and dark, save for that one thought
of revenge, burning like an evil star through the
chaos of gloom in my soul. At last, with a bitter
oath, I remounted and rode back to Orleans,
giving my horse his head and the spur, seeking
in his speed some relief for the torment in my
mind; essaying, in short, to perform the impossible,
and to flee from myself.</p>

<p>To this day I have no recollection of how I
passed the city gates, of when and where my horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>slackened pace, and I only realized that I had
come back when the beast stopped of his own accord
under the snarling lions over Cipierre’s gates.</p>

<p>When I entered the hall I found the Vicomte
there, pacing backward and forward with a
disturbed and anxious air. He almost started as
he saw me, and asked in a breath:</p>

<p>“Has anything happened? You are as white
as a ghost&mdash;where is Jean?”</p>

<p>In my heart I cursed my tell-tale face, but answered
calmly enough:</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened. Marcilly is with our
man, as far as I know.”</p>

<p>“And you did not stay?”</p>

<p>“I had other work. I escorted Madame de Marcilly
to St. Loup. She is now with the Princess.”</p>

<p>“Oh! They have made a mess of things,” he
burst out. “I am certain that Catherine knows
where the Princess is, and at the first check will
hand her over to the Philistines.”</p>

<p>“But there has been no hitch up to now?”</p>

<p>“<i>Mordieu!</i> Do you know that this morning we
were within an ace of losing our heads?”</p>

<p>“Indeed! What happened?”</p>

<p>“There was a council this morning, a hurried,
sudden council, to consider the Constable’s move.
The Guise was not there. He refrained from coming;
but that Red Phalaris, the Cardinal, urged
the hastening of his bloody design.”</p>

<p>“The execution of Condé?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He and his creatures wanted it done at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>once. Sancerre and myself protested. He then
threatened us with a like fate. There was a
stormy scene; but the Chancellor stood firm.
My God! He is the one honest man in France!
A Prince of the blood was not to be dragged to
death like a common malefactor, he said, in flatly
refusing to affix the great seal to the decree.
Then the Cardinal played another card. The
safety of the kingdom was above the law&mdash;that
was the point he pressed, and I believe he would
have won, but for the sudden news that the King
had been taken with a seizure, and commanded
the instant presence of Catherine and the Chancellor.”</p>

<p>“A move of the Medicis to delay things.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, perhaps not; but it has given us
breathing space. The Council is adjourned until
to-morrow afternoon. As he left Charles of Lorraine
turned to Sancerre and myself, saying that
to-morrow he would produce such evidence that,
seal or no seal, the Prince would die,” and he
added, with his sinister smile, “in company
too.”</p>

<p>I thought of my compact with Achon, but merely
said:</p>

<p>“So they want another Amboise.”</p>

<p>“But we will balk them yet, I hope. I have
sent a trusty messenger to the Constable urging
him on no account to delay, and Sancerre has
fled.”</p>

<p>“Sancerre gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; an old fox knows how to guard his
brush, and we both had warning enough.”</p>

<p>“But you, monsieur,” I asked, “do you stay or
go?”</p>

<p>He looked up at me, for all the world like an
old boar at bay, and laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;go! No! If it comes to the worst I have
sixty tried men at my back. This house is strong
and amply provisioned, and if I have to die, it
shall be sword in hand on my own hearth.”</p>

<p>As he finished the bell in the courtyard clanged
out the hour. It was already seven. Cipierre
spoke again at the last stroke.</p>

<p>“I am going my rounds. Will you come with
me?”</p>

<p>I, however, excused myself, and waited until I
heard him ride out with his guards. Then summoning
Badehorn, I gave him a short note to
Marcilly, informing him briefly that his wife had
reached St. Loup.</p>

<p>“Give this to Monsieur le Comte yourself, and
say that I will be late to-night. And, Badehorn,
when you have done this, ride straight to the
Château de St. Loup and await me there.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” and I was once more alone. I had
still a little time on my hands before the hour
of my tryst with Richelieu fell due. I went to
my room, changed my attire, and then made a
pass or two at the grotesque head of a griffin
in the corner of the mantel-piece of my chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>I was curious to see if I still remembered Touchet’s
favorite thrust, and I found I had not forgotten
the master’s teaching. The movement
came as cleanly, as easily as in the days when I
was wont to practise it for hours together before
a mirror, until even I myself could not see the swift
turn of my wrist or the point of my blade; and
I laughed a little in my heart as I thought of
this, and of yet another advantage that I had&mdash;I
was a left-handed man.</p>

<p>Then, taking my hat and cloak, I went out on
foot to find the sign of the Red Rabbit. I inquired,
of course, for the Jacobin priory, for
twenty would know that for one who might even
be aware of the existence of the tavern. I found
my information readily enough, and a little past
eight was before the priory, which rose into the
clear night grim and dark behind its high, spiked
boundary walls. Except where one faint ray of
light glimmered through a narrow window, making
a pale green streak on the screen of ivy
around it, the façade was in total darkness; but
I could see little from where I stood, except the
upper portion of the building, which was set far
back in what appeared to be a large garden&mdash;the
surrounding wall shutting out all further
view. I remained for a moment looking at the
vast irregular outline of the priory, here white
in the flood of the moonlight, there in deep, almost
solid, shadow, and, but for that faint light
playing upon the ivy, one might have thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>that the black-robed brethren had fled, leaving
their home to the bat, the owl, and the spectral
things of the night.</p>

<p>The road in which I stood was long and narrow.
On one side, almost for its whole length,
extended the gray line of the priory wall. On
the other hand, a jagged row of irregularly built
houses crowded one above the other, their gables
sharper, their pentice roofs sloping more steeply
than ever in the weird moonlight. Not a soul
was to be seen, and the sound of my own footfalls
came to me with sullen echoes, as, loosening
my sword in its sheath, I proceeded in search of
the inn, looking well to the right and left, for if
ever a place had “cut-throat” written large over
it, this was the spot. At last I saw a lamp burning
before me, and coming up to it, became aware
that I had reached my destination, for beneath
the light swung a white sign-board, with a red
rabbit painted thereon. The road, too, came to
a dead end here, and before me rose the crenellated
city walls, cutting off all further progress;
while beyond, no doubt, was the river. I crossed
over to the other side and found the little door
Richelieu had described, almost where the priory
wall joined on to the ramparts of Orleans. Then,
having some time to wait ere it struck nine, and
as it was useless hanging about the deserted street
like a prowling cat, I entered the inn.</p>

<p>The room was comfortable enough; a cheerful
fire was burning. There were tables, benches, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>chairs, and a couple of lanterns gave sufficient
light; but there was not a soul within.</p>

<p>“Strange!” I thought to myself. “Is the place
plague-smitten?” Then I called out, and from behind
a buffet, where he had been sleeping, a man
rose, and said civilly enough:</p>

<p>“Good evening, monsieur! I did not expect you
so soon.”</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i> You know me!”</p>

<p>The host, for it was he, shrugged his shoulders
and laughed. “It is simple; Monsieur de
Richelieu said that a friend of his would be here
to-night, and I made a guess.”</p>

<p>“A shrewd one, too.” I wondered to myself
what Richelieu meant, and if I was the person
expected. Then looking around me, I remarked:
“Your house does not hum with business, my
friend.”</p>

<p>“It hums enough for me. Messieurs of the Carabiniers
reserve it entirely for themselves and their
friends.”</p>

<p>“What! And you refuse all others?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, monsieur! But it is bad for the others
when messieurs are here.”</p>

<p>“I see. Are none of your friends here to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh! They will come later, about ten o’clock
or so.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i> They are late birds,” and, wishing to
end the conversation, I ordered some food and a
bottle of Vouvray; then, taking my place near
the fire, I sat down to my supper. Mine host
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>tried once or twice to draw me into further talk;
but finding his efforts useless, left me to my own
devices, and returned to his slumbers.</p>

<p>I ate but little, but sipped my wine and began
to brood once more over my wrongs, and the sullen
anger within me again blazed up fiercely. I
thought of Marie, but it was no longer with love.
For her sake I had cast aside all that a man
holds dear. She had made me dance like a marionette
for her amusement, and then&mdash;dismissed me
with a few cutting words, careless whether she
killed my soul or not. Such a thing was a monster,
unfit to live, a scourge that it would be
righteous to destroy; and&mdash;God forgive me! I
had sunk so low then that I was prepared to
go any lengths to satisfy the unholy craving for
revenge for which I thirsted.</p>

<p>Now holding my glass to the light, watching
the beads chase each other in the wine, then sipping
the Vouvray slowly, I went over my plan.
Yes, it was complete in every detail, and I gloated
over the joy that was to come to me when I repaid
my debt. As for Richelieu, he was but an
interlude&mdash;I hardly gave him a thought. I was
sick and sore at heart when he crossed me, and
had flown at him like a mad dog. If he won,
well, there was an end of things. If I won, I was
no better pleased than before, and yet so great
was my inward torment that I almost caught myself
wishing that Richelieu’s blade would find my
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>At last! After an interminable wait, in which
the minutes lagged like hours, I heard the compline,
and, awakening the host, paid him his score.</p>

<p>“Monsieur does not wait, then, for the Captain?”
he said, as he pocketed the coin I gave him.</p>

<p>“No; but perhaps I may return. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, monsieur.”</p>

<p>It was clear that I had been mistaken for some
one else, and then I remembered that Richelieu
had mentioned that he had another appointment.
The matter, however, concerned me not, so I
banished it from my mind, and, coming out of
the inn, I found myself in a few paces at the little
door Richelieu had described. I looked for a
knocker. There was none, so, drawing my sword,
I tapped three times lightly with the steel hilt.
A moment after it opened softly, and a tall figure
stood before me. It was Richelieu.</p>

<p>“You are punctual, monsieur,” he said, coldly
polite, as he stepped back to let me enter, and
carefully closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>I found myself in a garden within a garden.
In front of me rose the dead back wall of the
priory chapel, with its one pointed window in
darkness. On my right was the moss and lichen-covered
rampart. On my left, shutting us out
from the main garden, was a wall, thick with ivy
that glistened in the moonlight. We were, in
short, in a little square, admirably suited for the
purpose to which we were about to put it. The
foothold was sure, the moon perfect, and in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>white band of light between the two walls there
were no cross-shadows to spoil a thrust or balk
a parry. As I looked around me the key turned
softly, and Richelieu, removing his hat and cloak,
placed them under the lee of the wall. I followed
his example, and then, with God’s moon looking
down upon us, we stood before each other, death
in our hearts. I was facing the chapel wall, my
back to the door by which I had entered, and
as Richelieu took his place opposite to me I was
about to call out “on guard” and commence the
assault out of hand, when he spoke:</p>

<p>“My sword is, I think, longer than yours, monsieur.
I have another here of the same length as
mine. Would you care to use it?”</p>

<p>It was unlooked-for civility, but my heart was
hardened against the man, against all men, and,
false myself, I was only too ready to believe all
others as I was. That other sword might be but
a yard or so of soft iron that would buckle in
my hand, and I answered with a sneer:</p>

<p>“I will make up for the shortness of my blade by
the length of my arm. I trust my own steel only.”</p>

<p>“On guard!” was the sharp answer, and the
two blades came together with a little crash.
In the moonlight, bright and clear as day, I
caught a strange smile on Richelieu’s face as he
saw me use the left hand for my sword. He, of
course, remised at once, trying to pink me in
tierce, and the sparks flew as I parried and returned
high up at his throat, but my thrust was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>met by a master, and then he laughed, as he
sprang back a yard, and in an instant had
changed his sword hand, and I, too, was face to
face with a left-handed man. I saw at once the
disadvantage at which I was placed, and grew
hot with anger as Richelieu mocked me.</p>

<p>“I also can use the left hand, monsieur, but it
brings the heart too near the point,” and he
ripped me just over the heart at the last words.
I do not know why, but I felt that he had spared
me, and, sick with anger and shame, flew at him
like a tiger-cat, putting forth all my cunning of
fence, and he began to give slowly to the assault,
but always with that strange, half-mocking smile
on his face. He was giving ground, nevertheless,
and I worked him in a half-circle from his original
position, pressing him closer and closer each moment,
fiercely, but warily withal, and at last the
chance came. His blade seemed to yield to mine.
It was now or never. I made the feint in tierce.
He took the bait, and then, with all my strength,
I gave him Touchet’s great thrust&mdash;and the next
moment was disarmed.</p>

<p>Ay! At that instant I thought I had reached
his heart, his blade had twisted round mine like
a snake, and with a turn of his arm, from the
elbow to the wrist, he dragged the sword from
my fingers, with such force and strength that it
struck with a little clang against the rampart
wall, and then, rebounding, fell white and glistening
in the moonlight at our feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>We faced each other for a moment, and then he
dropped his arm, and the hot shame surged to
my forehead.</p>

<p>“End it,” I said thickly, but he laughed.</p>

<p>“There is yet time for another bout.” He
stooped and picked up my sword, saying as he
held it out to me, “I will say that there are
scarcely three men in France who could have met
that thrust&mdash;take your sword, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Consider for a moment in what state I was.
I was half mad with the tension of the past days.
I had meant to kill this man when I came here;
to kill him for a few trifling words; and in my
heart I felt I was doing him honor to let him
die by the sword of Vibrac. And what was the
result? I found myself, for all my vaunted skill,
a child in his hands; and he, the despised soldier
of fortune, the man on whose fame there were a
hundred blots, stood here giving me my life, and,
what is more, giving me a lesson in perfect knighthood.</p>

<p>I could not speak. My hand closed like a vise
on the hilt of the sword Richelieu held out to
me; but the cold steel itself was warm to my
icy clutch. I stood before him, a curse trembling
upon my lips and a hundred evil passions hissing
like snakes at my heart. Richelieu did not understand.
He spurred me with a gibe.</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur! Or are we to have a new
phrase instead of the Fever of St. Vallière?”</p>

<p>I was stung to the quick. “You shall die for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>this,” I gasped, and he laughed once more as our
blades crossed, and then&mdash;a dark shadow fell between
us, and a stern voice cried:</p>

<p>“Hold! What fool’s work is this?”</p>

<p>We turned to the sound, and before us stood
Achon, his face gleaming like ivory above his
black robes; but it was not he who arrested our
attention, whose look froze the words of defiance
upon our lips. It was that other figure, a little
behind the priest, taller by a head than any of
us, with a purple scar on his cheek, and a sombre
fury burning in the eyes, that held us spellbound
with their power. His was the voice that had
arrested us in our devil’s work. He it was upon
whom we gazed. Ay! I have known brave men,
men to whom death was nothing, men who
played with life as a child with a ball, yet never
one so hardy as to stand without flinching before
The Guise in his wrath.</p>

<p>“The Guise!” stammered Richelieu; but I said
nothing, looking at the sinister figures before me.
And at Richelieu’s voice a grim smile passed over
the duke’s face.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” he said, “your memories are short.
Have you already forgotten du Charry? Is an
edict but a week old to be made waste-paper?”</p>

<p>We knew what he meant, and there rose before
me a vision of poor du Charry, whom Guise had
hanged at his own gate for the very offence of
which we were guilty, and the prospect of a like
shameful fate sent a shiver through me. I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>certain, too, that we had never escaped but for
the dark schemes the duke was weaving in his
brain. Du Charry was only an idle brawler. He
killed his man, and his own gate-posts made his
gallows; but we&mdash;we had our use at present, and
that&mdash;it was nothing else, I am sure&mdash;saved us
from the hangman. We made no answer to Guise;
but Achon whispered low to him, and he spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Put up your swords”; and, with a cynical
frankness, “it is well for you I have need of you
at present. Remember, however&mdash;I hold this
against you.”</p>

<p>We did as we were bidden, Richelieu with a
slight, almost imperceptible shrug of his shoulders,
and a look at me as if to say “another
day,” and as my sword went home in its sheath,
Achon turned to me.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, “you have found your
way here more easily than I expected, and before
your time. Perhaps, however, it would be
as well to get to our business now.”</p>

<p>The hour for which I had waited had come at
last. I had longed for this; thought over and
planned out all I meant to say. It had become
as familiar a thing to me as the sword by my
side. And yet, so strange was my nature, as
Achon spoke, as my revenge came within arm’s
length of me, I lost all the thread of my scheme.
I hesitated and faltered.</p>

<p>I can see it all now before me: the square of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>dazzling moonlight, the gray walls of the Priory,
with that one faint light burning in a distant
wing. Achon was facing me, and his white face
would have been like that of the dead, but for
the starry eyes and red, cruel lips, on which there
played the flicker of a smile. Richelieu stood
glancing from one to another of us, swinging his
plumed hat in his hand, and a little on one side
towered the gigantic figure of Guise.</p>

<p>And now I spoke, fencing with the thing that
was to be.</p>

<p>“I understand, monsieur, that the Chancellor
and the Cardinal were to have been present.”</p>

<p>“Things have changed, Monsieur de Vibrac.”
It was Guise who answered me, not Achon. “The
Chancellor will not be here, and as for my brother
of Lorraine&mdash;well, I stand in his place.”</p>

<p>I bowed. “And monsieur!” I looked at Richelieu.</p>

<p>“Remains,” said Guise briefly; “proceed.”</p>

<p>I knew I had that to tell which would give me
the revenge for which I thirsted; but the words
would not come. Something held me back, perhaps
the last feeble effort of my good angel. It
still fought within me, though the battle was
lost; yet for a moment it seemed that it might
prevail.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur!” I said, “it was arranged that
the Bishop of Arles was to make certain statements
which I was to corroborate if I could&mdash;nothing
more!” The words seemed to give me relief.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
I had spoken of this to Marcilly. There was
no betrayal here.</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Achon, “and it is as well
that Richelieu remains to bear witness to what
passes, especially as your friend Ponthieu has escaped,
and my fools bungled over the letter we
wanted,” and then, without more ado, he detailed
briefly what we know, confining himself exactly
to the facts, but skilfully bringing them home
against Condé. When he had done, Guise turned
to me.</p>

<p>“You bear witness to this as correct?”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur.”</p>

<p>“You have heard this, Monsieur de Richelieu?”</p>

<p>“I have, your Highness.” Something in the Carabinier’s
voice made me glance at him; but his
face was like stone.</p>

<p>There was a little silence, and then the duke
said:</p>

<p>“He is a lost man&mdash;nothing can save Condé
now.”</p>

<p>And Achon laughed long and low to himself.
What ran in his mind, what fancy moved him
to a joy that chilled us, I know not; but the high
chapel wall echoed back the mirthless chuckle, as
though some fiend flitting above us shared in his
secret thoughts, and rejoiced in his fearful gladness.</p>

<p>We looked at him in astonishment and amaze,
but at last he put his thin hand to his breast as
if to stay himself as he asked me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“And have you nothing else to say, de Vibrac?”</p>

<p>“Is more wanted?” It was the Guise who
spoke, with a touch of impatience.</p>

<p>“Ay! There is more, monseigneur,” and Achon
again turned to me. “Do you remember, de Vibrac,
that I told you before you had trouble
there?” And his hand rested again over my heart
as it had done for a moment at Larçon, and
dropped on the instant as he continued: “Here
is the clew that led me to read you. Here are the
letters I promised you. Take them&mdash;but you have
more to say, Vibrac. Am I not right?”</p>

<p>What hideous prescience possessed this man!
My thoughts came thick and fast upon me, and,
as I thought, his eyes seemed to read into my
very brain. I tried to steady myself.</p>

<p>“You know I have more to say,” I said. “Are
you a sorcerer?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur; but a priest to whom secrets
come. And they laugh, monsieur; they laugh at
de Vibrac and the sport he has made for&mdash;&mdash;”
He stopped; but he had said enough. I would
not have heard him if he had spoken more. The
place, the hour, all before me was changed. I
was once again listening to Marie’s mocking
words; and all the horrors of the past were upon
me. They laughed. Did they? I would turn their
smiles to tears of blood; and then I spoke.</p>

<p>It was more than they expected to hear. My
first words made even Guise start, and Achon’s
lips, red as a wound, to pale to gray. But I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>getting my revenge. I could not think of anything
but that, and at last it was over, and I
stood before them the basest of men.</p>

<p>Not a word did they say in interruption or comment;
but when I had done they left me where I
was, Richelieu still a pace or so from me, leaning
on his sword and twisting his moustache with his
hand. After a while&mdash;I know not how long it
was, for my mind is almost a blank when I strive
to recall those moments&mdash;they returned and said
something to Richelieu, to which he answered
simply with a bow.</p>

<p>Then they turned to me where I stood, a drumming
in my ears, a dull, aching pain at my heart;
and Achon’s voice came to me as from a far distance.
He was speaking to Guise: “You see,
monseigneur, that his attempt to join the Constable
is open war, and will utterly damn him.
Let him reach St. Loup, and we have the whole
hive, queen bee and all.” Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac! You will not speak of
this to a soul. Go on as before. Let none suspect
you. Take the Prince to St. Loup to-morrow.
We will bring him back, and then&mdash;&mdash;” He
began to laugh again; but Guise checked him.</p>

<p>“Let this end,” he said, and addressed me.
“You have your instructions, monsieur, and the
reward will come.” So saying, he took Achon
by the arm, and they passed out through a door
in the wall that separated us from the main
garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>I looked after them stupidly, my mind still
dazed and blurred, and a shame to which all other
shame was as nothing throbbing through me.
I turned to Richelieu, I know not why, and he
stepped back a pace, as he would have from some
foul thing.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, “our other meeting cannot
take place. Even you must know why. Monsieur!
I have been in many lands, I have seen
strange things, good things, and evil things;
but&mdash;so help me God!&mdash;I have never yet seen a
thing so evil as this&mdash;I have never yet seen man
fall so low as you. The key is in the door, monsieur;
and you will find the street dark enough,
even to hide your shame.”</p>

<p>With this he left me, following the others, and
I, the mean, the abject, staggered toward the
door like a drunken man, and, like the evil thing
I was, flitted through the night.</p>

<span class="smaller">A QUOTATION FROM VIRGIL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> hurried</span> on, utterly careless whither my footsteps
led. Richelieu’s speech burned within me,
and my very soul shrivelled under the fierce light
he had poured upon it. I saw myself in all my
infamy. I cursed, again and again, the coward
heart that had not nerved my hand to strike him
dead, as he flung at me those bitter words of insult
and scorn. But a guilty conscience makes
a craven soul, and the lesson was brought home
to me, as with blanched lips and trembling limbs
I went on, keeping in the shadow, looking neither
to the right nor to the left. Now and again I met
a few passers-by, but, night-hawks or honest
men, they left me the road, until at last I would
have been glad if one of them had even drawn
upon me.</p>

<p>Finally I reached the Martroi and gained my
chamber in Cipierre’s house. Alone there I tore
the letters and the glove into shreds, and cast the
fragments into the fire; then I flung the sword
that had served me so ill to a corner of the room,
venting upon the senseless steel some of the fury
in my heart, and, undressing, lay down to sleep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>But no rest came to my hot eyes, and I spent
the weary hours counting the diamonds on the
lattice window, watching the moonlight fade into
darkness, and listening to the sighing of the wind,
which rose with the setting of the moon and
gave promise of a day as gray as sorrow.</p>

<p>I did not rise till about the dinner hour, eleven
o’clock, and when I descended, I found the Vicomte
and Jean awaiting me. I was surprised
at my own self-control. During the hours of the
night, my heart had, as it were, steeled itself
within its guilt. All sensations of regret or remorse
were numbed and paralyzed. I thought
them dead. All that lived within me was a burning
hate against those whom in my madness I accused
of bringing me to the pass to which I had
sunk, and so I gave my traitor hand to both
Cipierre and Marcilly, and sat down to eat with
them, cordial and even gay. I had some right to
be gay. In a few hours my revenge would be
complete.</p>

<p>At last the moment came for us to start upon
our perilous enterprise, and we stood at the door
ready to mount, a couple of Swiss with us. There
was no “good-by” said. To all intents we might
have been making our daily visit to the Prince;
but Cipierre’s hand lingered in that of his nephew,
and when he took mine in his clasp, he gripped
me like a vise in his excitement.</p>

<p>“Once free, you will ride hard, de Vibrac,” he
whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“Trust me for that, monsieur!” and, springing
into the saddle, I followed Marcilly into the
street.</p>

<p>The promise of the dawn had been fulfilled, and
there was a dense fog in the air, blurring the outlines
of the houses, and making the figures of the
passers-by loom like indistinct shadows. In truth,
it was difficult to see two yards ahead, and Marcilly,
as he held his hand out before him, said:</p>

<p>“If it keeps like this, and we bring off the stroke,
you will get out of Orleans without a question
being asked.”</p>

<p>“De Bresy sticks in my mind,” I answered. “He
never leaves us. I begin to fear he more than
suspects.”</p>

<p>“We have provided for that in part. While you
were away we arranged that the Prince should
pretend to be suffering from a chill, and keep his
bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will go in and see him, and as I take
the Prince’s place you and Vaux must settle with
de Bresy. Vaux knows his part, and you must
not fail.”</p>

<p>“A man will not cry out if a dagger at his
throat commands silence,” I answered; “he will
be killed at the first sound he utters.”</p>

<p>“Not that if you can help it, Vibrac.”</p>

<p>“That is de Bresy’s affair,” I replied, and with
these words we came to the gate of the house in
the Rue Parisis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>The same formalities in regard to our entrance
were observed as before, and leaving the horses
outside with the Swiss, we walked into the courtyard,
where de Bresy met us.</p>

<p>“That was an unlucky match at tennis,” he
said, as he greeted us; “the Prince has taken a
chill and keeps his bed.”</p>

<p>Our faces showed nothing but the utmost concern.</p>

<p>“He is not bad, I trust?” asked Marcilly, adding,
“have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! ’Tis but a chill that will pass off in
a few days, unless&mdash;&mdash;” and he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Let us not speak of it, de Bresy; we know
what you mean,” and the archer swore under his
breath, muttering something as we entered the
corridor, followed even here by the fog, which
filled the galleries and rooms of the prison with
its blue, semi-opaque vapor.</p>

<p>“I never remember such a fog in Orleans,” said
Marcilly, and almost at the same time I spoke
myself:</p>

<p>“How went the match, de Bresy? You remember
our wager?”</p>

<p>“You lost by a stroke; but we are to play another
match; would you care to make it double
or quits?”</p>

<p>“Take him, Gaspard,” laughed Marcilly; “double
or quits on the next match we play. You will
lose, de Bresy.”</p>

<p>“I take the wager,” I smiled, catching the hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
meaning in Jean’s words, and we found ourselves
on the landing before the Prince’s apartments,
the door of which was, however, closed.
The subaltern officer was on guard there, and de
Bresy addressed him.</p>

<p>“How is the Prince, Comminges?”</p>

<p>“Vaux tells me he sleeps, but that if these gentlemen
came they were to be admitted, as the
Prince desired to see them.”</p>

<p>“We can wait in quiet in the ante-room,” said
Marcilly in a low voice, and then de Bresy led us
in.</p>

<p>Vaux, the Prince’s page, was alone in the room,
building a house of cards at the table. He looked
up as we entered, put his finger to his lips, and
whispered:</p>

<p>“He sleeps still.”</p>

<p>“Does any one watch by him?” asked Marcilly.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Vaux; “but shall I arouse Monseigneur?
He desires much to speak with you.”</p>

<p>“Better that he slept. I shall, however, go in
and sit by the bedside until he awakes. I will
not disturb him in the least.” So saying, Marcilly
gently pushed open the door leading into
the bedroom and passed within.</p>

<p>Vaux, with a careless sweep of his hand, knocked
down his house of cards, and as he gathered the
pack together, looked at us, saying:</p>

<p>“Shall we take hands, messieurs, to while away
the time?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” replied de Bresy, “but three is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>an unlucky number. Comminges shall make the
fourth.”</p>

<p>He turned to the door as if to call out, and
Vaux bit his lip with anger as he just flashed a
glance at me. I was, however, in time.</p>

<p>“It is needless, de Bresy. I cannot touch a card
to-day. I know not what it is, but I have no
humor for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come! But a few rounds,” said de Bresy,
as he turned to me, picked up some cards, and
began shuffling them in his hand.</p>

<p>While he spoke Vaux had made a movement
toward the window. He was behind de Bresy
now, and his poniard gleamed in his hand. I
held him with a look, and de Bresy went on, all
unknowing of the danger behind him.</p>

<p>“’Tis a curious pack this, Vibrac. Do you see
the illuminations on the backs of the cards?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I noticed them before. They are Viterbo
cards, I think.”</p>

<p>Vaux had made a step nearer his man. His
eyes were blazing. I could not have stayed him
if I would; but at that moment there was a
noise at the door, and the page had just time to
turn to his window like a flash, when Comminges
entered the room.</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” he said bluntly, addressing de
Bresy, “here is a letter for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Comminges,” and as de Bresy took
the letter I glanced at the soldierly figure of the
lieutenant. It was evident that he was one who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>had risen from the ranks, and twenty years of
war had left their scars on his rough features.
There he stood, the type of the soldier who has
become a machine, whose life is regulated by his
orders, and as I took in the square jaw, the firm,
resolute features, and keen, deep-set eyes, I thought
to myself that it would be a far cry to the gates
of the prison even if de Bresy were disposed of.
And as my mind ran on thus, a low exclamation
burst from de Bresy. He crumpled the paper in
his hand, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>“There is no answer, Comminges.”</p>

<p>The subaltern bowed stiffly and withdrew.</p>

<p>“It is infamous,” said de Bresy as if to himself,
and then he caught my eager look and Vaux’s
glance&mdash;the page had turned from the window
and approached us when Comminges spoke. His
hand, however, no longer held a poniard.</p>

<p>“There is nothing new against the Prince?” I
asked, and de Bresy laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“Monsieur of Arles writes to me to prepare the
<i>cachot</i> for our prisoner to-night.”</p>

<p>“The <i>cachot</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes. ’Tis a dog’s business, and but that my
honor is pledged, I would see it to the winds&mdash;a
Prince of the blood in the <i>cachot</i>!”</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck me as he spoke. It
was one of those inspirations that come in moments
of suspense.</p>

<p>“But you surely have no <i>cachots</i> here?”</p>

<p>“As good as in the Châtelet, monsieur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“I saw the Vidame there,” I said, “and know
the Châtelet. I doubt if what you have here is
anything like that.”</p>

<p>“Would you care to see for yourself? I have
the key here,” and de Bresy pointed to his side,
where at his belt a large key hung attached to
a thick silver chain.</p>

<p>“Well,” I answered, “it will kill some of the time
we have to spend here, waiting for the Prince to
awaken. Will you come, too, Vaux?” And as I
glanced at the page my eyes told him to say
“No.” He was quick to grasp this; but he was
also a good actor, and he hesitated a moment
before replying.</p>

<p>“I think not, monsieur. I shall await your return
here.”</p>

<p>We left him, card-building once more, and
stepped out where, after a few words with Comminges,
de Bresy led me through the corridor, and
stopped before a small, iron-studded door. Beside
it, in a niche, a lantern burned, and taking this
in one hand my companion opened the door, and,
as it swung back creaking, he pointed downward
with his key, saying:</p>

<p>“<i>Facilis descensus Averni.</i>”</p>

<p>I laughed as I looked down the black passage,
with its old and worn steps. I laughed because
I thought it would be for me to finish the quotation;
and then I followed de Bresy as he picked
his way downward. Twice were we stopped by
doors, each of which he opened with his master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>key, and each as it opened disclosed a stairway,
darker, more hideous than the one before. And
now we found ourselves in a small landing, facing
yet another door.</p>

<p>“We have come,” said de Bresy, putting down
his lantern as he used his key again. He had to
push twice at the door, before it went back on
its hinges with a sullen groan, and before us lay
a dungeon which all but matched the <i>Chausse
d’Hypocras</i>, that fearful prison den of the Châtelet.</p>

<p>“Does that satisfy you?” asked de Bresy, as we
gazed on the damp and dripping walls, where
the drops of water oozing from their surface
flashed like gems in the ruddy light of the lantern.
Even against myself I shuddered.</p>

<p>“To put him here!” I muttered, and de Bresy,
catching the words, spoke again.</p>

<p>“You will judge better if you step within. Except
just outside this door not a voice could be
heard, call it ever so loudly.”</p>

<p>I wanted a moment to think, and did as I was
bidden. The next instant the door closed behind
me with a crash, and I was in total darkness.
Outside I heard de Bresy laughing, but it was as
the laugh of a man coming from a far distance.</p>

<p>I staggered back blindly, and my groping hands
felt the wet and slippery walls; and then on the
instant the whole horror of the thing seized me.
Tricked! Cozened! Trapped like a fox! With a
curse I flung myself at the door and battered at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>it with both hands. I might as well have tried to
tear down Notre Dame with my fingers. In those
moments I lived years. I was bursting with shame
and mortification. No long-eared ass could have
walked into a pitfall more easily than I had done.
And then I heard de Bresy’s voice again, and the
door slowly swung back. As the light fell on me,
he rocked in senseless, foolish laughter.</p>

<p>“Ye gods!” he almost screamed, “I did but try
you, de Vibrac. You are as white as a sheet.”</p>

<p>I came out slowly and laughed myself&mdash;a harsh
laugh that rang back from the vaulted roof.</p>

<p>“’Tis a sorry jest, monsieur, and one for which
you must answer me.”</p>

<p>He simply bowed&mdash;my tone had sobered him&mdash;and
turned toward the lantern. Ay! The fool
had given me the key to my difficulty in his idle
jest. Quick as thought I was on him, but he
turned like a wildcat at me, and for a moment
we grappled together. Backward and forward
we swayed. I heard the key he held fall with a
clash to the floor, and he caught at my wrist,
for my hand was at his throat, and he tugged
vainly to free himself.</p>

<p>He was sinewy as a leopard, but it would have
been a strong man who could have stood against
me then, and I held him like a vise. Even by
the dim light of the lantern I could see his face
grow livid, his lips blue, and his eyes almost start
from their sockets. He struggled like a fish in
a net, poor wretch! But at last his knees went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>from under him. Slowly, slowly, he yielded, and
I felt him limp as a sack in my arms. One effort,
and I flung him from me through the open door
of the dungeon, and heard him fall with a half-smothered
cry. He lay there like a log, and, closing
the door after him, I picked up the key and
turned the lock.</p>

<p>Then I waited in the silence, slowly arranging
my disordered dress. When I had finished, I lifted
up the lantern, and as I did so heard a faint cry:
“Open! Open, de Vibrac!”</p>

<p>There were a hundred agonies in the voice; but
he had made me pass through them before. I
laughed in my turn at de Bresy, as I repeated
and finished his quotation:</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SHAME OF VIBRAC</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven</span> as the words fell from my lips, their other
meaning flashed upon me in vivid, insistent
light, and the mockery I flung at the poor fool,
there battering at the door with frantic hands, rebounded
upon me with double force. It was I&mdash;I,
whose steps could not be retraced. It was I,
who was held prisoner in shades to which the
darkness of that dungeon was sunlight.</p>

<p>And with this thought came the first sharp
sting of remorse. But I had burned my ships. I
could do nothing. Whether I stood fast to my
evil compact with Achon or held back, the result
would be the same. Those whom, in my madness,
I had betrayed were compassed on all sides.
For them there was no escape. And there was
none for me. My path was before me; onward,
where my revenge held out a Tantalus’ cup,
whose sweetness would never touch my lips. I
put aside the thoughts that came crowding upon
me in that stifling air, and, seizing the lantern,
went back alone, whence we had come, two together.
As I shut the first door I stopped to listen
if any sound could be heard from the dungeon,
but all was silent. Slowly I went upward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>closing the doors after me, and at last reached
the landing. Fortunately there was no one there.
I replaced the lantern in its niche, locked the door
carefully, and, slipping the key in my pocket,
made my way back to the Prince’s apartments.</p>

<p>De Bresy was disposed of for a time. Luck and
his own folly had favored me in that, but there
still remained Comminges to be dealt with.</p>

<p>I walked along the corridor, whistling the
“Rappel d’Aunis,” and found the lieutenant on
his eternal guard. The man never seemed to eat
or sleep. He looked at me from under his bushy
eyebrows as I came up, and asked, in his gruff
brusque way:</p>

<p>“Where is Monsieur de Bresy?”</p>

<p>“He is busily engaged at present.”</p>

<p>“Engaged! Monsieur has done his rounds.”</p>

<p>“Probably he has business in connection with
the letter you gave him, monsieur.” And then,
to avoid further inquiry, I began questioning him
myself.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if the Prince is stirring?”</p>

<p>He glanced toward the door, which was closed
on account of the chillness of the day, and
shrugged his shoulders; but I went on, as if time
was no object to me.</p>

<p>“Marcilly has not gone, has he? He said he
might have to go early.”</p>

<p>“Oh! He is here still.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“As I am here. There is only one way out&mdash;through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
this door&mdash;and I have been here since you
came.”</p>

<p>“You have long hours.”</p>

<p>“There is an old proverb, monsieur, ‘Fast bind,
safe find,’” and he again shot a keen glance at
me.</p>

<p>Clearly it seemed that Comminges was on the
alert. But too much caution often overreaches
itself, and I took heart from the thought, as I
rubbed my hands together, saying, with a little
shiver:</p>

<p>“Ugh! It’s cold here; and the fire in the room,
there, is crackling cheerily.”</p>

<p>Comminges said nothing, but as I slipped into
the room he followed me; not so fast, however,
but that I was able to exchange a nod with
Vaux, who had to turn aside to hide the blaze
of eager curiosity in his eyes.</p>

<p>From within the inner room there came a low
murmur of voices.</p>

<p>“So he is awake,” I said, and Vaux answered:</p>

<p>“Yes. He has been awake for the last quarter
of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall go in,” and I tapped at the door.
A weak voice replied, “Enter!” and as I made a
movement forward I saw Comminges at my
heels.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” I said, “this is His Highness’ bed-chamber.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” he answered grimly;
“I desire to inquire after his health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>The suspicious ring in his voice was not to be
mistaken, and it was absolutely necessary for me
to have a few minutes alone with the Prince and
Marcilly. Knowing the class from which Comminges
sprang, I at once chose my line of action.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Comminges,” I said kindly, “it is
a Prince of the blood who lies there, prisoner
though he be. Even Monsieur de Bresy does not
visit him without notice, and I am sure that
least of all would you, a gentleman and a soldier,
intrude upon him. Perhaps I had better announce
you. It will not delay you above a minute
or so.” I looked at him steadily as I spoke, and
the very gentleness of my tones made the reproof
harder. He flushed under his tanned skin, and
drew back a little. It was enough; and, without
waiting for his answer, I stepped in, closing the
door upon Comminges.</p>

<p>The room was in semi-gloom; the curtains of
the bed were drawn, and within it lay a figure
covered to the ears with rugs. Another figure
sat by the edge of the bed, and the fitful flames
of the fire burned redly through the uncertain
light, half day and half night. As I entered the
watcher by the bed rose to his feet, and I whispered
quickly, “De Bresy is safe, Marcilly,” and
then Condé, for it was he, began to chuckle, and
I saw my mistake. “Your pardon, Monseigneur&mdash;the
light deceived me.”</p>

<p>From within the bed came a hacking cough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“The poor Prince has a bad cough,” said Condé,
as he shook again with silent merriment; but I
stopped him&mdash;there was no time to lose&mdash;and
whispered quickly what we know, merely stating
facts and going into no details.</p>

<p>“Let Comminges enter,” said Condé, when I
had ended, adding: “He would be flattered if
allowed to watch by His Highness.”</p>

<p>I nodded and moved toward the door; but
the Prince stayed me.</p>

<p>“A moment!” he said, and stooping over the
bedside, he whispered something in Marcilly’s ear,
pressing his hand in good-by. Then he rose and
turned to me.</p>

<p>“I will admit Comminges. Stay here and keep
him engaged until I slip out.”</p>

<p>With these words he moved forward toward
the door, leaving me by Marcilly, the friend whom
I had betrayed to his death. I stood there, shame
and remorse in my heart, and tongue-tied with
my own infamy. I dared not address a word to
him, but kept my face averted. I heard the door
open softly, and Comminges step into the darkened
room. The Prince moved backward into the
shadow of the door, as if to let him pass, making
a little motion with his hand toward the bed.
As the heavy footfall of the lieutenant fell on the
floor, and his huge spurs jangled, Marcilly broke
out again into his cough, and, turning uneasily
on one side, closed his eyes, as if in sleep.</p>

<p>“He is bad,” I whispered to Comminges as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>came up to the bed; “much worse than I
thought.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at me and then at the
figure before him as I continued in the same low
tone:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur is touched by your kindness in
coming. The cough has exhausted him, but as
soon as he recovers he will speak to you.”</p>

<p>“I had better have René sent for,” he began.</p>

<p>“You would be wise, but there is no immediate
hurry, and the Prince wishes to thank you in
person for coming. He will recover himself in a
moment.”</p>

<p>He was about to say something, but I saw
that Condé had got out of the room, and, staying
Comminges with a gesture of my hand, I
pointed to the still figure on the bed.</p>

<p>“He sleeps, I think. Sit here beside him, monsieur,”
and I indicated a large easy-chair by the
bed. “The slumber is fitful, and he will awake
in five minutes.”</p>

<p>Comminges hesitated for a moment, and then
accepted my invitation. We waited in silence for
a little, listening to the heavy breathing of the
sick man. Finally I spoke again in low, subdued
tones.</p>

<p>“Marcilly and I are going now. May we send
René in to you?”</p>

<p>“It will save time,” he answered, and bending
over the sleeping figure, I cast a look at Jean.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>Then I gave Comminges my hand in adieu, and,
putting my finger to my lips to enjoin silence,
stepped out on tiptoe from the room. As the
door closed behind me I saw Condé and Vaux
together, and the latter’s face was all smiles. I
took the key of the <i>cachot</i> from my pocket and
handed it to the page.</p>

<p>“You can give this to Comminges in an hour’s
time, with the compliments of Monseigneur,” I
said, “and you might add that Monsieur de Bresy
is, perhaps, in need of some fresh air.”</p>

<p>“How on earth did you get him there?” began
the Prince; but I interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, your Highness, as we ride&mdash;let
us not delay now.”</p>

<p>Vaux would have dropped on his knee to say
farewell, but Condé restrained him, taking his
hand in a warm clasp.</p>

<p>“<i>Au revoir!</i>” he said, stepping toward the
door, and as I followed him I called out somewhat
loudly, “Make our compliments to the
Prince, Vaux, when he awakens.”</p>

<p>The next moment we were in the corridor, and,
walking together arm in arm, discussing the
Prince’s illness, we passed slowly out, receiving
the salutes of the sentinels. In the misty courtyard
we ran no risk of discovery, but at the gate
itself there was some slight danger. The sergeant
of the guard was there, so we called him
up to us, and I placed a brace of gold crowns
in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“From Monseigneur the Prince,” I said, “for
you and the guard to drink the King’s health.”</p>

<p>“And the Prince’s, too,” was the answer, whereat
we laughed, and, wishing him good luck, passed
him. He had seen Marcilly and myself on our
entrance. Our going out was in the natural course
of things, and the fog and the chink of gold disarmed
suspicion.</p>

<p>Outside we found the horses, and, mounting
them, rode slowly off, followed by the Swiss.</p>

<p>As we entered the square of Ste. Croix I reined
in, and, calling the Swiss up to me, said to them:</p>

<p>“Go, and await us at the palace gates. If we
are not there in an hour, you may return home
and tell the Vicomte.”</p>

<p>They were men to whom orders were orders,
not things to be questioned. They simply saluted
and rode on, gray shadows in the mist; and then
I said to the Prince:</p>

<p>“Now, Monseigneur!”</p>

<p>He was leaning back in his saddle, straining his
eyes through the yellow fog back upon the Rue
Parisis.</p>

<p>“If they touch a hair of their heads,” he muttered,
“they will never forget the vengeance of
Bourbon,” and he turned to me as I pressed him
again with another reminder.</p>

<p>“Come, de Vibrac! You are right. Let us
hasten.”</p>

<p>We put our horses to the trot, slipping through
the dim day like ghosts, down the long streets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>where the houses loomed on each hand like phantom
buildings, through the straggling Portereau,
and at last, freeing the gates, gained the open
country.</p>

<p>Condé rode a little in front of me, his hat
pulled over his brows, the collar of his coat well
turned up, and his head held down. We went on
in silence, for it was not a time for talk.</p>

<p>When we passed the city gates, a little breeze
sprang up, lifting the mist, and blowing it along
in billows that chased each other like the breakers
on a sea-bound coast. The sun, which had
hitherto burned dully through the fog, a great
orange globe of fire, now began to cast its clear
light upon the landscape. As the cheery beams
fell upon us, Condé awoke from his torpor of
thought and slackened the steady canter at which
he was going to a walk.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, “we are not two monks of
La Trappe. Tell me, Vibrac, how you disposed
of de Bresy? how you put him in a cage? Oh!
they will laugh! They will make verses about
him!” he went on, breaking into laughter himself.</p>

<p>But I was in no mood for mirth or talk. I
wanted to get the business over, and I said
gravely:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur! It is a long story, and the Constable
is far. I pray you, let us hasten on! No
one knows what danger may lie within these
woods.” And I looked to the right and to the left
of me, where the sunlight cast its swords of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>flame into the shivering, uneasy mist; down the
long glades which the bright rays carpeted with
gold, and behind the tall and tangled brushwood
that hid the winter-stricken tree-trunks. I almost
hoped to catch somewhere the gleam of a breastplate
or the flash of a sword. The sooner things
were over the better. But no! For all I could
see, we might as well have been on some desert
island in mid-ocean, as on that desolate and unending
forest way.</p>

<p>Condé had followed my glance and noticed the
grave tone of my voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Pardieu!</i>” he said, “but you are a dull dog!”
And then, in his quick, impulsive way, he stretched
out his hand. “I did not mean to offend you.
Ah! monsieur! Believe me! I thank God that
He has given Louis of Bourbon such friends as
you.”</p>

<p>I could not touch his hand. I was not so base
as that; and I felt my face burn as I saluted him,
saying with a voice that shook despite my efforts:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur! Let us hasten. Every moment
is full of peril.”</p>

<p>He did not understand my confusion; but he
waved an airy farewell toward Orleans.</p>

<p>“Free! Free!” he exclaimed. “Thank God and
my good friends! Come, Vibrac!” And we galloped
on again, black care on my shoulders; but
he, he the betrayed, was happy as a lark in
spring, and as we rode through the brightening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>day, he broke into song, his voice, mellow and
rich, echoing through the ringing woods.</p>

<p>Each joyous note stabbed me like a knife, as I
thought how soon that song would be changed
to a wail of lamentation. In the crowd of
thoughts that surged upon me, my confused brain
fluttered hither and thither, like a netted bird
seeking chance for escape. It came upon me to
warn the Prince while there was yet time, to
stop him, tell him what I was, and bid him ride
to the Constable’s camp for dear life. But that
would not save the others! Alas! the pitfalls
were too surely dug! And then the shame of it
choked me. I could not. I dared not; and so I
let the precious moments pass.</p>

<p>And now a momentary strength came, and I
nerved myself with a mighty effort. It should
be done, come what may! With a gasp I called
out:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur! Monseigneur!”</p>

<p>He turned and reined up, following my example,
looking at me with curious eyes as we halted,
facing each other. But somehow I could not
speak. I made an effort, hesitated, and stopped,
looking helplessly about me.</p>

<p>“What is it, de Vibrac?”</p>

<p>“I thought some one was lurking here,” I said
desperately, to gain time as I peered into the
woods.</p>

<p>Condé bent forward and took a pistol from his
holster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I was foolish to sing,” he said, and
began to look too.</p>

<p>But there was nothing, and as I gazed I became
aware that we were on the spot where I had
parted from Marie. I could almost see her before
me, her eyes flashing, the jewelled whip
swinging to and fro in her hand, and her lips
curled in scorn as she flung her taunts at me.
Once more her words rang in my ears, and rang
with them the death-knell of my resolve. Loyalty,
honor, an unsullied name&mdash;all these I had
sold to my evil desires, and should I not be paid?
No! I would not go back. I would have the
price of my soul. I would have my revenge, betide
what may! I made a movement as if to
go on, saying:</p>

<p>“There is nothing. I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I think not, Vibrac. Hark!” And as Condé
spoke, from within the dark woods a horse
neighed shrilly. I felt on the instant what that
meant, and answered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“’Tis from St. Loup. See, monseigneur!” And
pointing before us, a little to our left, I showed
him the face of the château with its two pepper-box
towers rising above the trees.</p>

<p>“To think I should not have noticed it!” he exclaimed.
“Why, we are almost there!”</p>

<p>“We will be there in ten minutes.” I answered, as
we trotted forward, my eyes here, there, and everywhere,
seeking for those who were to take part in
the final scene that would give me my desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>But there was nothing; not a leaf stirred, not
a branch crackled, though I knew they were
around us, and I rode on, cursing the delay, for
as the moment approached I was worked up to
a fever heat.</p>

<p>In effect it was not quite ten minutes before
we saw the mouldering walls of St. Loup. The
gates lay open, and we galloped through them,
and along the deserted ride, the reckless Condé
giving forth a loud “Halloo!” to announce our
coming. As he did so, something made me turn
and glance back over my shoulder. Under the
arch of the avenue I could still see the gate, and
at its entrance stood a single horseman, gazing
after us. But now the ride bent sharply to the
right, and I lost him to view as we took the turn
and followed the curve that swept in a half-circle
to the doors of the château. But brief and momentary
as my glance was, I had recognized the
figure. There could be no mistake. It was Achon
himself.</p>

<p>We drew rein at the entrance, and a man hurried
up to hold our horses. It was Badehorn,
and he bent forward and kissed the Prince’s hands
ere he took the reins. And then I heard a glad
cry, and Condé, springing from his horse, ran up
the wide steps to meet a slight, gray-clad figure
that fluttered toward him, with arms held out,
and the love-light shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Safe! Safe! Oh! thank God!” Her arms were
round his neck, as she hung over him with tender,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
wifely words of love&mdash;but I cannot write of
this. I did not dare to look, but with head held
down and shaking hands, fumbled nervously with
the straps of my nag’s girths. Now, too, all
those who were there gathered around, and it
seemed as if the steps were full of figures. There
was a murmur and buzz of welcoming voices, as
some one&mdash;it was Coqueville&mdash;put an arm through
mine with a warm pressure, leading me on until
I found myself near the Princess. She took my
hand, that lay as cold as ice in her own warm
palms, and faltered:</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur! God bless you!” With this all
speech seemed to fail her, and she burst into an
April shower of glad, happy tears.</p>

<p>But I shivered and shrank back from the words
of praise, and the kindly faces that crowded round
me, and then I felt a light touch on the sleeve of
my coat, and a slender figure was before me, pinning
with trembling fingers a bunch of winter
violets to my coat. It was Yvonne de Mailly, and
the girl’s face was flushed and her sweet eyes were
wet with tears.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” she said, “we women are proud of
a brave man.” And then she stepped back amid
the surrounding smiles, and I turned with a sob
in my throat, for my eyes to fall on Marie, where
she stood a little apart, gazing at me gravely,
and as the sun lit the gold of her hair, and I
caught the look on her face, my mind went back
like a flash to the vision I had seen in Russy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>wood, and I stood there tongue-tied and staring,
as without a word she turned aside from me.</p>

<p>The tumult of feelings raging within me almost
choked me. My mind travelled with lightning
rapidity from remorse to a savage, relentless fury,
from the deepest pity to a stony apathy. It came
to me once, as we entered the house, to draw my
dagger and plunge it into my own heart, and on
the heels of the thought followed another. There
was no one here who knew, and Achon and Richelieu
would perhaps be silent. What mattered it
to the priest how he gained his end as long as
he did gain it? And as for Richelieu, bandit and
ruffian though he was, he had shown me a stately
courtesy when my life was in his hands, so I
leaned upon the self-interest of the one and the
chivalry of the other, and held myself in.</p>

<p>We had gained the hall by this. Twice had I
felt, rather than heard, Coqueville speaking to
me. At last he put a hand on my shoulder and
shook me gently.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon ami!</i>” he said, “do you dream?”</p>

<p>“Ay!” I answered, my hand to my forehead.
Then, with a sudden rush of feeling I could not
control, “Coqueville!” I said, “take them away
at once. Delay not here a moment. There is
danger&mdash;danger, I say.”</p>

<p>My voice was harsh and high. The words arrested
all, and the Princess began nervously:</p>

<p>“Yes. Let us go! We are quite ready.”</p>

<p>“And so are the horses in the inner court,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>madame,” said Coqueville; while Condé, reckless
and gay, slipped his arm round his wife’s waist
and kissed her. “Fear not,” he said; “Vibrac has
sniffed danger the whole way. Not a soul suspects&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And a single shot rang sharply through the
air.</p>

<p>We started, even I, so suddenly, so crisply did
the sound come to us through that winter day;
and then another and another followed it, but
from the other side of the house.</p>

<p>“What is it?” And Marie, who had flown to
the window, turned with a white face to the
Princess’ cry.</p>

<p>“We are betrayed! The place is full of men.”</p>

<p>Before she finished speaking we heard the galloping
of horses&mdash;they seemed to come from all
sides&mdash;then the brazen ring of a trumpet pealed
harshly out, and there was a hoarse command:</p>

<p>“Guard all the doors! Let none pass!”</p>

<p>With a snarling oath, Coqueville sprang to the
doorway, sword in hand, and I rushed after him.
Condé would have followed us, but loving arms
held him back, and with a strength that one
could hardly believe she possessed the Princess almost
dragged him toward an inner door.</p>

<p>“Here! here!” she gasped; “there is a way here&mdash;ah!”
And she shrank back, for the door had
opened upon her, and a man reeled in, mortally
wounded. It was Badehorn.</p>

<p>“We are lost! They are in the courtyard!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>So saying, he slipped down limply, and in the
hour of his death became a child again, and went
back to his native tongue, groaning out some
words, as he died, in his guttural German&mdash;God
knows, they may have been prayers.</p>

<p>And while this happened in a hand-turn, there
came an angry knocking at the door, and a loud
voice called:</p>

<p>“Open! Open in the King’s name!”</p>

<p>The surprise was complete, and we were caged
as securely as rats in a trap. Condé looked at
the blanched faces of the women, then at us, and
then glanced from the window, while the knocking
grew angrier and the voice louder.</p>

<p>“Open in the King’s name!”</p>

<p>Then he bent down, gravely this time, and
kissed his wife again, and as she sank weeping
into his arms, he said calmly to us:</p>

<p>“Open!”</p>

<p>But Coqueville hesitated, and the Prince had to
command him twice before he sullenly drew the
bolts, and, opening the door, stepped back to
my side; and in a moment there was the jingling
of spurs, the clash of scabbards, and the room
was thronged with armed men, at the head of
whom stood Achon, and by his side was the tall
figure of Richelieu.</p>

<p>Condé, his arm still round his wife’s waist, a
little group of scared faces behind him, stood in
the centre of the room, proud and dignified. I
had moved back a pace from Coqueville, somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
into the shadow. Now that the blow had
fallen, I was dazed, bewildered; my mind seemed
a blank.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur!” and Achon made a slight gesture
of his hand behind him, “you see, resistance
is hopeless.”</p>

<p>“None has been made,” answered Condé dryly.</p>

<p>There was a little silence, and then Achon turned
to Richelieu:</p>

<p>“Their swords, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Coqueville was the nearest. As Richelieu approached
him, he said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur! Your sword, in the King’s name.”</p>

<p>“It came from a King, and it goes to a King,
monsieur,” and Coqueville obeyed, handing his
sword to Richelieu, who received it with a low
bow. Then he glanced at me, a secret scorn in
his look; but Achon’s voice cut in sharply:</p>

<p>“His, too, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Richelieu shrugged his shoulders, and called to
a trooper.</p>

<p>“Truchepot&mdash;take monsieur’s sword&mdash;my hands
are full.”</p>

<p>All eyes were upon me; the contempt in Richelieu’s
voice was not to be mistaken. Achon looked
on with a mocking smile on his lips.</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” I began; but Condé’s voice stayed
me:</p>

<p>“Vibrac! Not a word, I command you&mdash;give
up your sword.”</p>

<p>I let it fall with a clash on the floor, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>the trooper stooped to recover it, acting on some
secret signal two others ranged themselves on
each side of me.</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur! Let this farce end. Where
are you going to take us?”</p>

<p>It was Condé who spoke, and Achon answered
him:</p>

<p>“Back to the Rue Parisis, Monseigneur&mdash;and if
your Highness will give me your faith not to
escape, I have no wish to deprive you of your
sword.”</p>

<p>“I make no pledge&mdash;give no promise.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness must then be treated as the
others. Richelieu, you will receive Monseigneur’s
sword.”</p>

<p>Richelieu stepped forward, but Condé said
coldly:</p>

<p>“You mistake, monsieur; a Prince cannot surrender
his sword to an unfrocked friar, and”&mdash;he
looked at Achon&mdash;“still less to a priest.”</p>

<p>Richelieu bit his lips with anger, but Achon
smiled again, his cynical, mocking smile, and
turned to me.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Vibrac! There can be no higher
honor than to receive the surrender of a Bourbon.
I confer it upon you for your services&mdash;will
you have the goodness to take His Highness’
sword? It will make us quits on the score
of Ponthieu&mdash;and other things.”</p>

<p>The devilish malignity of the man stunned me.
I could say nothing, but stood there like a stone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>Every eye was fixed upon me; and then Achon
continued, in his cold, measured voice:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur! You look as if you thought me
mad. Let me tell you that I am only paying
a traitor his account. Every detail of the plan
for your escape was disclosed to us by your good
friend there&mdash;ask him to deny it if he can.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible&mdash;it is an infamous lie!” exclaimed
Condé, and there arose a buzz of astonishment
and amaze. I stood transfixed, shaking
in every limb, my coward heart almost dead
within me.</p>

<p>“Look at him!” repeated Achon, and then a
figure ran out from the group behind the Princess,
and Yvonne de Mailly, her eyes blazing, her
voice shrill, stood before me.</p>

<p>“Say it is a lie!” she said; “say it is a lie!”</p>

<p>There are things the mind feels, and knows to
be true, instinctively. I lifted my head and looked
into the girl’s hot eyes, and read there, in that
moment, what, had I not been a blind fool, I
might have known a year before. And she, she
as she met my gaze, saw too, and it was something
that paled her to the lips, something that
made her cower and shrink back from me. Her
woman’s heart had told her what I was, and
with a smothered cry she threw her arms up,
and burst into peal after peal of mirthless laughter.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> an overwhelming disaster befalls one,
when the whole ship of one’s life founders
hopelessly, it is perhaps decreed in mercy that the
full horror of the thing cannot be realized at the
moment it happens. Little by little it breaks in
upon the understanding, and it is only when the
mind gains strength to endure, that it has the
power to realize.</p>

<p>At least so it was with me. I can only judge
from myself, and I have but a dim and vague
recollection of those minutes, which were to me
the most terrible of my life. There was a sound
as of the sea roaring in my ears. The room
seemed to enlarge to infinite space, and the crowd
multiply itself to countless thousands, all watching
me, and in the long vista of faces there was
but one look on each and every countenance, an
unutterable scorn, an unspeakable contempt. My
strength was shrivelled to nothing, my courage
gone to the four winds. Above all, a voice of
agony ringing through a storm, came those peals
of pitiful, mad laughter. God grant I may never
hear the like again! Every second of that horror
stretched to a year. I turned a hunted, appealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
eye from face to face, but a mist seemed to
gather before me, until at last I caught Achon’s
glance, and the malign fire in it, the mocking
sneer in his look, shook the weight from my soul.
I sprang at him, but he was quick and stepped
back, though with a blue scar on his face where
my hand had touched him. Then those surrounding
us flung themselves on me, and there was a
quick, fierce struggle, for I fought like a mad
thing. They bore me down by the force of numbers;
but still as I struggled, and a sword was
pointed to thrust me through, I heard a woman’s
voice cry: “In mercy spare him!” But it was
not that appeal that gave me my life, and saved
me from the death I sought. It was Achon himself
who stayed the trooper’s hand.</p>

<p>“Bear him out and bind him securely,” he said;
and then, as he looked down upon me, his thin
fingers at the mark on his cheek, and the cruel
snarl of a cat on his lips, he added: “We have
not done with you yet, monsieur&mdash;you must be
paid your price in full.”</p>

<p>Some shred of dignity still remained with me.
I made no answer to the man, struggled no more,
but rose sullenly without a word, and let them
drag me into the open. There one loosed the
reins from a horse, and they bound me with
them like a thief, my hands behind my back.
With two men guarding me, I stood thus in view
of all, while the others were brought out, and
the troop formed around them. Perhaps in pity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>for me, they did not look; but the very sight
of those whom I had betrayed brought an agony
on me, and I strained at the thongs at my
wrists.</p>

<p>“Unbind me,” I said hoarsely through blue
lips. “I will not attempt escape; I pledge my
honor.”</p>

<p>And the troopers broke into coarse laughter
at my words, while Truchepot, the man who
had taken my sword, mocked me to his fellows.</p>

<p>“He pledges his honor,” he said. “Monsieur
would perhaps like his sword returned to him,
to wear as the Prince is wearing his.”</p>

<p>Whereat they laughed again, and I bit my lip
in silence; and then there was some one standing
before me, some one who had heard my appeal
and its answer, and I hung my head in shame
and utter abasement. It was Marie.</p>

<p>“May God forgive you,” she said, and with a
divine pity in her voice she added, “as I do.”</p>

<p>I did not dare meet her look, but half turned
away with a groan; yet something in the scene
stilled the gibing tongues of the troopers, and
they pressed between us in rough kindliness, so
surrounding me that for the moment I was hidden
from view.</p>

<p>I was mounted on a spare horse. Perhaps it
was one that had belonged to the dead Badehorn&mdash;I
cannot say&mdash;and with a trooper on my
left holding the reins, and one on my right, a
cocked pistol in his hand, I was put almost in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>the rear of the party. Then followed a few quick
commands, the trumpets pealed, and we were
on the way back to Orleans. We went at a smart
trot, for it was evidently the intention of our
captors to reach the city ere sundown, and, bright
as the day had become, the lights of sunset were
already showing in the west.</p>

<p>Of the other prisoners I could see nothing except
Coqueville, and he rode almost immediately
before me, but with this difference, that his hands
were free and his horse was not led. I do not
know why, but I kept watching him with a
strange fascination as he rode on, apparently in
the deepest dejection, his head held down between
his shoulders. I knew his mount too. It was his
own mare, Lisette, and she also seemed to be
possessed with the same despair as her master,
for she lagged and hung back, until we in the
rear almost rode over her quarters. But notwithstanding
this, she still kept going slower and
more slowly, her tail switching nervously to and
fro, and her ears laid back over her head. Seeing
this, the men on each side of Lisette exchanged
some rough joke about feminine temper, and closed
in on Coqueville, forcing his nag on. And then
I noticed that his left foot was out of the stirrup,
and stretching his leg outward with a
quick, rapid motion, he spurred the trooper’s
horse next to him. It swerved slightly, leaving
a space between them. Quick as thought Coqueville
touched Lisette on the neck with the flat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>of his hand, and, obeying the signal, she slung
half-round and lashed out. There was a curse
and a heavy fall as the stricken horse lurched
downward with its leg broken, and we behind
had to rein up sharply, to avoid riding on those
in front. In the momentary confusion caused by
this, a little space was left clear for Coqueville.
It was but a flash, a second of time that he had.
But he took it, and, as the kicked horse fell, he
lifted Lisette’s head, dashed through the opening
into the wood, and vanished.</p>

<p>In a moment there was a wild hubbub of kicking,
plunging horses around us. The man next
to me vainly fired his pistol after the fugitive,
and two or three of the troopers rode after him
in headlong pursuit. The whole line halted, and
Richelieu galloped up, white with rage. He saw
at a glance what had happened, and a short inquiry
told him who had escaped.</p>

<p>“Here, Poltrot!” he exclaimed to a sergeant,
“take half a dozen men and bring him back,
dead or alive, and a hundred crowns are yours.”</p>

<p>“You might make it five hundred with safety.
You will never have to pay. The Orléanais is
not long enough to give you time to catch Lisette.”</p>

<p>It was Condé who spoke, but Richelieu made
no answer, except that his cheek grew paler, and
he drew a pistol from his holster. The men whom
he had detached were gone, but the trooper whose
horse had fallen stood a little apart on the roadside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
staring stupidly at his beast, which lay there
in mute suffering. Richelieu turned to the man
and looked at him; and as I watched, helpless
and tied, his face seemed transformed&mdash;his eyes
burned, his lips were drawn back over his teeth
like those of a snarling wolf. At last he spoke,
in a voice that shook with rage:</p>

<p>“Was it you, Le Brun, who let the prisoner
escape?”</p>

<p>“My horse was kicked, captain, and I&mdash;I fell,”
stammered the man, and again came a laugh and
a mocking cry from the Prince.</p>

<p>“<i>Bon coq</i>, Coqueville!”</p>

<p>The words seemed to drive the savage to madness.
He glanced behind him with an oath, and
then, lifting his pistol, pointed it at Le Brun.</p>

<p>The man threw up his hands with a cry that
changed to a sob, for there was a sharp report,
and the wretch, spinning round, fell to the shot,
all huddled in a heap beside his horse. Slowly
the Monk put the smoking pistol back into his holster.
His eye fell on the troopers near him, and
they shrank at his look, cowed by the sullen
ferocity of his glance.</p>

<p>Then he called to one of the men:</p>

<p>“Put this horse out of pain and follow us&mdash;march!”</p>

<p>It may have been part of the iron discipline
by which a ferocious soldiery was kept in order,
but it was murder all the same&mdash;murder as foul
and cruel as ever was wrought by a human tiger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>in the face of God’s day. And now I began to
realize what manner of man this was whom men
called The Monk, and the stories I had heard of
him came back to me: How he was destined for
the church; how his fierce and turbulent soul
scorned the black robe and longed for the sword.
He fled from his convent. Caraffa, the legate of
the Holy See, relieved him of his vows, and no
more reckless cavalier fought through the Italian
war. He returned a merciless soldier, a fit instrument
for the dark designs of those who sought
to kill the faith with the sword. But the cup
of his wickedness was brimming over, and the
day of vengeance not far, when he, too, was to
die by an assassin’s hand. I often wonder if any
thought of poor Le Brun ever flashed before the
glaring eyes of Richelieu, that bleak January
night, when he lay poniarded and dying like a
dog, on the pavement of the Rue des Lavandières.</p>

<p>We rode on, the men in an awestruck silence,
and even I forgetful of myself in the horror of
the thing that had happened. And yet, swift
and awful as Le Brun’s fate was, it was merciful
to that which every day men, women, children,
yea! even babes, had to suffer in the years of
the War of the Religions. The times had turned
men’s hearts to stone, and life, the life God gave
us, was of less value than the dust beneath our
feet. But I was not then old enough to be callous,
and I never became so. The long years of
my seclusion have prevented me from being hardened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
to scenes like these. And as I thought of
Richelieu and his terrible deed I began to see how
far, how irrevocably, I had fallen. Black as his
shield was, it was starred by the fires of a dauntless
courage. Cruel as he was, his word was inviolate,
and there were times, too, when no knight
of old could have borne himself more gallantly.
None knew that better than I. And I shivered
and shrank in my soul with the cowardice of
guilt as I thought how even he, evil among
the evil, had turned from me in contempt and
loathing.</p>

<p>So I rode on, my bitter thoughts preventing
me feeling all pain from my bonds, my own self-reproach
making me callous to the scorn that
was ever and again glanced at me, and the tramp
of hoofs, the jingle of chain-bits, and the clank
of scabbards made a sad accompaniment to the
riot in my mind.</p>

<p>At last, a few minutes after sunset, in the brief
interval when the winter twilight hung before
the gray of the night, we reached the city gates.
They were shut, but the officer on guard, the same
Italian whom we had met when Marcilly and I
entered Orleans, opened them as we came up,
and a short conversation ensued between him
and the leaders of our party. At first I could
hear nothing; but as the prisoners were massed
up, I was brought close to the speakers, and saw
that Achon’s face was clouded and full of misgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Four couriers, did you say, Carandini?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur&mdash;and there are already some on the
part of the Constable who have reached the palace.
’Tis said that he himself lies just outside
the Portereau.”</p>

<p>Then a word or two were exchanged in low
tones between Richelieu and Achon, and the former
called a subaltern officer.</p>

<p>“Carouges&mdash;take half the men, and escort the
Princess and her suite to the Jacobins. You will
keep them under careful guard. There must be
no time allowed for leave-takings. We look after
the others.”</p>

<p>The order was obeyed to the letter; not but that
Marie obtained a moment’s speech with Achon.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” she said, “I pray you let me join
my husband. The favor I ask is so small. In
mercy grant it.”</p>

<p>And he looked at her with a cruel light in his
eye, while the mark that my hand had made
on his face seemed to grow darker, as he said:</p>

<p>“You will join him later on, madame&mdash;he is in
the arms of the Holy Office.”</p>

<p>The pitiless meaning of his words was clear as
daylight. She gave a little gasp and strove to
speak, but speech would not come to her, and
then I found voice, and saved her from humbling
herself in vain at the feet of the priest.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame! Ask him nothing&mdash;beg not from
him!”</p>

<p>Simple as the words were, they steadied her,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>and gave her the strength she needed. She lapsed
into a proud, cold silence, and reined back, while
Achon bent toward me.</p>

<p>“You, too, are of those whom the Office needs
but before it touches you, monsieur”&mdash;he paused
and his hand passed over his cheek ere he continued:
“I will deal with you, and after that you
will bless the rack and the estrapade when they
come.”</p>

<p>I laughed back at him in reckless scorn, as he
turned away; and then we divided into two parties&mdash;I
being placed with the one in which Condé
was, and that headed straight for the house in
the Rue Parisis.</p>

<p>We were closely guarded. The troopers hemmed
us in, so that we could barely see anything, except
the men around us; but, nevertheless, in the
glances I shot to the right and to the left, I was
aware that there was a strange commotion in
the streets. As we rode on there were voices
raised in angry murmurs, and all around us there
was a humming as of bees. Richelieu saw this,
and doubled his precautions, riding close to
Condé’s side himself, and Achon’s face became
graver as he went onward. Near the Martroi,
which I passed with shuddering horror, we came
across a party of the Queen’s guards, with Lorgnac
at their head; and by his side&mdash;I could scarce
believe my eyes&mdash;was Ponthieu.</p>

<p>They were coming toward us; but whether by
accident or design, I cannot tell. They filled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>road, scarce leaving us room to pass. Seeing
this, Richelieu called out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“Way! Way for the prisoners of the King!”</p>

<p>Lorgnac gave a sharp order to his men, calling
them aside; but the crowd heard The Monk’s
words and began to murmur, while Ponthieu,
reckless as ever, raised a shout of “Bourbon,
Notre Dame!” In a moment the mob caught up
the cry, and it passed from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>At the time Achon was quite close to Ponthieu,
and he turned on the Gascon fiercely.</p>

<p>“You shall smart for this. I know you,” and a
gibing answer came back to him:</p>

<p>“I have not the like honor, monsieur, yet I
have given a livre for masses for the souls of
your dead guards&mdash;&mdash;” and what more he would
have said it is impossible to say; for here Lorgnac
cut him short, seizing his reins and forcing
him back, as he waved us on:</p>

<p>“Pass, gentlemen! We give way to the King’s
prisoners.”</p>

<p>And as we went on, the guardsman and Richelieu
exchanged glances that crossed each other
like two sword-blades.</p>

<p>It was a narrow affair, and escaped but by a
hair in ending in bloodshed. That something of
import had happened I was sure now; but as
yet I could not tell what it was, and neither
Achon nor Richelieu knew, too, though they
guessed that trouble was afoot, and a pistol barrel
gleamed in the latter’s hand, where he rode
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>almost boot-to-saddle with the Prince. And so,
on we rode, through the darkening streets, and
at last we were again before the prison. Here,
as elsewhere, a mob that grew in numbers each
moment had gathered, as if expecting our coming;
but whether it was the persuasive force in
the muzzles of the Emperor’s Pistols, which leered
down upon them from the walls, or whether the
crowd was simply in a sullen, speechless mood,
I know not. All I do know is that there was
neither cry nor shout as they passed; but a murmuring
that rose and sank, to rise and fall once
more, like the distant voice of the sea on a level
shore.</p>

<p>And now we halted before the gates. The
trumpets pealed out loudly, and the huge doors
groaned back in opening, disclosing the courtyard
lined with armed men, while de Bresy and
Comminges stood in the archway.</p>

<p>“You have them?” asked the former eagerly;
and Richelieu answered briefly:</p>

<p>“All but Coqueville.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, both de Bresy and Comminges
saw me, and the former said, with a forced
laugh:</p>

<p>“So it is my turn again, monsieur. This time
you will find it no jest”; but Achon answered
him, not I, saying chilly:</p>

<p>“He belongs to the Holy Office, monsieur, and
to none else beside.”</p>

<p>De Bresy remained silent, and with this we entered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
In the courtyard there was a little bustle
as we dismounted, and, awaiting my fate, I looked
around me in stony apathy. Then moved, perhaps,
by the same impulse that sometimes makes
a stag, wounded to death, nibble at the grass
around it, I cast my eyes on the sunset, and the
strangeness of it held and arrested me, in spite
of myself. There was a broad red sash of light
across the west, that cut abruptly, and without
any gradations of tint, into the sombre gray of
the sky. Against this weird background rose the
brown and purple silhouettes of the houses, the
white and glistening spires of Ste. Croix, and the
grim keep of the palace, the Royal standard
flaunting from the staff. Even as I looked it
seemed to slip down a little with a jerk, and
then fluttered slowly down to half-mast height.
No one noticed this. All were busily engaged,
and Richelieu, Achon, and the others were in earnest
converse. Achon was urging something, a
desperate resolve on his face; but de Bresy shook
his head, his hand to the hilt of his sword, and
Comminges said loudly:</p>

<p>“No! It would be murder. We are not here
for that.”</p>

<p>Whereat Richelieu put his hand on the priest’s
shoulder, saying: “Let it rest. ’Tis but a matter
of hours.” Then, as if to end the colloquy,
he turned to the guards, saying sharply:</p>

<p>“Bring on the prisoners!”</p>

<p>It was then that Condé looked at me for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>first time since the discovery of my shame. “He!”
he said. “And with me!”</p>

<p>“No, monseigneur,” Achon answered, “with me&mdash;he
remains in my sight from now,” and his
hand once more touched his bruised cheek.</p>

<p>So, guarded and still bound, I was taken with
them, as the Prince was led back to his old prison.
In the landing at the end of the corridor I was
stopped.</p>

<p>“Let him be kept here until I come back,” said
Achon. “See that he does not escape you!”</p>

<p>And the troopers on each side of me smiled
grimly in answer. The fate of Le Brun was too
recent to allow them to forget their vigilance.
With a parting look at me, Achon followed the
others into the room, and the door being open,
I was enabled to see and hear what passed.</p>

<p>As the Prince stepped in, Vaux, who was still
there, came forward with hanging head and tears
in his eyes; but Condé, who took no notice of
his captors, embraced him, saying, kindly:</p>

<p>“Come, Vaux! ’Tis the fortune of war,” and
than he looked at the card table where Vaux
had rebuilt his house of cards. He touched it
with his fingers, and as it crumbled on the table,
he laughed as he turned to De Bresy.</p>

<p>“Dreams of our youth&mdash;eh, de Bresy?” And then
with a perfect coolness he went on, taking a seat
at the table: “The long ride has tired me, and
I need a rest. Come, de Bresy! Play me a rubber.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“I am at your Highness’ commands,” and de
Bresy, taking a place opposite to the Prince, rapidly
shuffled the cards. They were cut to him,
and he dealt out two hands amid a wondering
silence. Vaux had slunk to the window, and the
Prince completely ignored the presence of Achon
and Richelieu. As for Comminges, he was at the
door near me, and I heard him mutter under his
breath:</p>

<p>“Ay! He is brave.”</p>

<p>“The old stakes?” The Prince was laughing
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Your Highness.”</p>

<p>“You lose, de Bresy. I would put my life on
this hand.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur!” It was Achon’s harsh voice
that broke in upon them, and Condé looked up,
a cold inquiry in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur!” the bishop went on, “I have
that to tell you which admits of no delay&mdash;&mdash;” He
stopped, the unspoken words still on his lips,
for the deep boom of a heavy gun fell upon our
ears, and from outside there was a shouting from
ten thousand throats:</p>

<p>“The Constable! Long live the Constable!”
and louder and yet more loud came another cry,
“Long live Condé! The Prince is saved!”</p>

<p>De Bresy almost rose from his seat, but the
Prince bade him play on, paying no heed to the
cries, and half turning his back on Achon. Richelieu
and Comminges had dashed from the room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>and for once Monsieur of Arles stood irresolute
and amazed. The suspense lasted but for a moment.
There came another shout and the tramp
of hurrying feet. It was Richelieu returning with
a pale face, but around and behind him were
other figures. There was Cipierre, his grim face
beaming; there was another who came with
halting steps of pain, but his eye was bright,
and there was a flush of joy on the cheek of the
great Chancellor of France. There were others I
cannot name, but as Richelieu hurried to Achon’s
side and whispered something in his ear, something
that turned his cheek to ashes, there was
a joyous shout of “<i>Bourbon, Notre Dame!</i>” and
Ponthieu came through the crowd. He pressed
to the Prince’s side, and, leaning over the table,
said low, but still loud enough for me to
hear:</p>

<p>“<i>Notre homme est croqué</i>&mdash;the King is dead.”</p>

<p>Condé looked up quietly. Then he turned to
de Bresy and spread his cards face upward on
the table, saying, with a smile:</p>

<p>“You see&mdash;I hold four aces.”</p>

<p>The next minute the room was filled and the
passage choked with men. On all sides I heard
the words, “The King is dead!” “The Constable
is at the gates!” All around me were the men
of the Queen’s guards; the others had gone.
There was a face there I knew well, and as yet
the man there did not know my shame. It was
Lorgnac, and as our eyes met he stepped to my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>side, his poniard in his hand. With two or three
quick cuts he freed me, and then shook me by
the hand.</p>

<p>“It is all over with them,” he said, with a
smile. “You are safe now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE AFTERMATH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> made</span> no answer to Lorgnac, but stood for a
moment incapable of thought or action;
hardly, indeed, realizing that I was free from my
shameful bonds. Around me was a sea of faces,
and I felt as if all eyes were upon me, although in
the gloom one could scarce see a sword’s point
ahead. All that could be discerned was a confused
crowd of shadows, with here and there the flash of
a breastplate or the gleam of a steel cap, as they
caught and reflected some lingering ray of light.
The thronged room beyond was, however, in
brightness. Some one had lit the lamps there,
and from where I was leaning against the wall
I could see an ever-changing crowd pressing
round the spot where Condé stood. High words
were passing, too, and there was a veiled threat
in the Chancellor’s voice, as, leaning his shaking
limbs on his crutches, he turned on Achon in answer
to some speech made by the bishop.</p>

<p>“Monsieur! There is no lieutenant-general of
the kingdom now. That office died with the late
King.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>“And I demand Marcilly’s release.” It was
Condé’s voice that cut in, and Achon answered
sullenly:</p>

<p>“You must ask for him from the Holy Office,
and its hold is firm.”</p>

<p>“But he shall be freed, or you, Monsieur of
Arles, will answer for it.” And now I could
wait to hear no more. My scattered senses were
recovering themselves. I could not linger until
all knew my shame, and this they would know
soon enough, for such things travel like lightning
from mouth to mouth. Lorgnac was still
near to me. He still believed me to be a man
of honor. He would help me once more, and
bending forward I said to him:</p>

<p>“Monsieur! Can you get me out of this? I&mdash;I
must go.”</p>

<p>He nodded and smiled. Then putting his arm
through mine, he led me along the passage into
the courtyard. None dared to hinder him. Even
if they had dared, they could have done nothing,
for everywhere around us were the Queen’s guards.
The gates, too, were no longer kept by the archers,
but by grim-looking men in a strange uniform
of sombre black.</p>

<p>“They are the gendarmes of Aunis,” said Lorgnac,
as we passed the gates. “And, now, adieu!
I suppose I shall see you to-morrow at the palace,
in the Prince’s suite.”</p>

<p>I took the hand he held out to me for a moment,
and, muttering my thanks, turned hastily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>and mingled with the crowd on the pavement,
leaving Lorgnac staring after me in astonishment
at my abrupt departure.</p>

<p>In a crowd one is soon lost, and in the uncertain
light it would have required sharp eyes to
have recognized me, as I threaded my way
through the heaving throng. Not that I gave
a thought to recapture. My mind was absorbed
with one idea, and that was to put miles between
me and the scene of my shame. For the moment
I was tortured by neither remorse nor fear. I
seemed dead to all sensations. All that I wanted
was to quit Orleans.</p>

<p>Finally I reached a street that was still in quietness,
and halted under a lamp set in the wall of
a house above the image of the Virgin. I looked
around me. There were but few people stirring
here, but some shops were open, and one of these,
almost opposite to me, was a place where I saw
that I might renew my apparel to some extent,
and perhaps get another sword. My purse was
still with me, and it was heavy enough, for I
was rich in the world’s goods. I determined to
act at once; so, crossing the road, I went into
the shop and purchased what I wanted&mdash;a stout,
serviceable sword and a good cloak. The shop-keeper
tried to enter into converse with me about
the events of the day, the death of the King, and
other things, but I cut him short, and paying him
his money, stepped out into the street. Once
there, I walked on at a brisk pace toward the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>city gates. No one attempted to stop me, and
passing through, I gained the river shore, and
looked out for a ferry-boat, but there was not
one in sight. I stood for a little, straining my
eyes into the night. The moonlight fell soft and
clear on the long quay, and on the slow, creeping
river before me. Behind me was the city,
and the hum of voices joined themselves to the
dreamy lapping of the Loire at my feet. On the
opposite bank of the river, the night lights of a
few boats were burning, and farther still twinkled
a long chain of camp-fires, marking the spot
where the Constable lay. Thrice I hailed a boatman,
calling loudly, but there was no reply, and
I heard nothing except the hum from the city
behind, and the whisperings of the stream before
me. Seeing at last it was useless to waste time
here, I turned to the left, and followed the river
face, hoping to come across a boat, but with no
results. Finally I stopped again and looked
around. Yes! There was no doubt of it. I was
close to the spot where Caillaud had suffered his
martyrdom, on the day of our entry into Orleans.
The scaffold was still there, the stacks of
wood, not completely used, near it, and perhaps
the ashes of the fire were still warm. I stepped
up to the scaffold, and, as I did so, a homeless
dog rose from behind the wood, and with a quick,
short bark at me, fled into the shivering night.
From the distance I heard him howling, and my
heart sank within me as I thought how even a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>dog had fled in terror at my approach, a dog to
whom I meant no harm.</p>

<p>There as I stood near the scaffold, my mind
was again full of bitter thoughts, of useless self-reproach,
of hopeless sorrow. I looked toward
the river. It moved so calmly. It was so still
and deep. Under its placid surface perhaps there
would be peace. Better death than this torment
in my soul. I made a step toward it, but
whether it was cowardice or not, I cannot say;
but I stayed myself, and then that hope which
never dies flickered once more in my heart. Perhaps
I could retrieve myself. If not, surely there
was another death yet left to me to die. Not
this! I moved back again near the scaffold, and,
seating myself on the pile of wood, began to
think; but my brain seemed stricken with palsy.
All that flamed before my mind, in endless scrolls
of fire, was the thought of my infamy. I rose
again, but a mist seemed to gather before me.
There was a drumming in my ears, and, tottering
forward, I clung to the scaffolding to save
myself from falling. With my hands clenched to
the hoardings, I stood shaking in every limb, and
then I suppose I must have fainted. I seemed
to be dropping, dropping through endless space,
amid the turmoil and din of chaos, amid the unearthly
mowings of devils rejoicing at my fall.
Then all became blank oblivion. Slowly, slowly
I came to myself, and, after a minute or so,
gathered strength to stand without the support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>of the hoardings. I wiped my forehead, which,
cold as it was, was damp with sweat, and once
more looked around. It was evident that the
excess of my mental torture had broken my
strength, and strength I must have to go. I determined
to retrace my steps, obtain some food,
and then risk swimming the Loire, if necessary,
to get out of Orleans. I found myself, soon after,
in the Rue des Tanneurs, and finally reached a
little square just beyond St. Pierre le Puellier, in
the corner of which stood a cabaret of some pretensions.
Obscure as the square was, cold as the
night was, there were numbers of people about,
and, as I peered into the cabaret, I saw that it
was all but full. Every gossip, every babbler,
every idler who had a brown piece in his pocket,
was spending it in Vouvray, in Rochecorbon, or
in Cognac, while he talked over the news. I
entered quietly, and, seeing in a corner a small
vacant table, settled myself there, and ordered
some food and a bottle of wine. The food I could
barely touch, although I forced myself to eat a
little; but the wine warmed me, and I began to
recover my faculties, and also gained some of that
courage that liquor gives to the weakest.</p>

<p>Up to now I had taken no notice of the company
assembled, but as I leaned back and glanced
around, I saw, at a table not four paces from
me, a half-dozen men seated together drinking
and gossiping. Imagine my astonishment on seeing
among them Brusquet, the jester, and Carouges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the officer of carabiniers, who had been
placed in charge of the escort that was to conduct
the Princess of Condé to her prison in the
Jacobin priory. Brusquet, I was aware, knew
me, and Carouges&mdash;had he not been a witness to
that awful scene at St. Loup?</p>

<p>They were between me and the door, else I
had gone out. As it was, I had to wait, trusting
that their preoccupation, and the shadow in
which I sat, would prevent them from recognizing
me, and resolved to take the first convenient
opportunity to depart. And so as I sat I became
a compulsory listener to their talk. I caught
Carouges’ voice at the end of a sentence.</p>

<p>“Faith of a gentleman! I never saw a man
look so, and hope never to see one again. If
ever coward and villain were stamped on a man’s
face, it was on Vibrac’s.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said another, whom I knew not,
“there are those who refuse to believe the
story&mdash;&mdash;” but Carouges interrupted him, saying
a little haughtily:</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Quesnay, I was there, and he
owned to it&mdash;the cur!”</p>

<p>“<i>Hein!</i>” And Brusquet flapped the bladder attached
to his sceptre on the table. “<i>Hein!</i> But
Vibrac only illustrates what I was always telling
my little brother Francis, God rest his
soul!”</p>

<p>“And that was?” asked two or three voices.</p>

<p>“That ambition and love will ruin the best man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>My cousins of Guise illustrate the first, and in
Vibrac we have the proof of the second.”</p>

<p>“Mention them not in the same breath,” exclaimed
Carouges, and the jester answered, waving
his sceptre up and down:</p>

<p>“<i>Oui-da!</i> Vibrac was a good enough sword in
the Spanish war, and in the Milanese. No? No!
I know more than you about this, Carouges,
but, of your grace, pass the Milan cheese&mdash;I am
not yet thirsty enough.”</p>

<p>He helped himself to some cheese to whet his
thirst, and, filling his goblet, raised it to his lips.
While he drank Quesnay took up the talk.</p>

<p>“But the other&mdash;Marcilly&mdash;he has not escaped,
has he?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Carouges; “he dies to-morrow.”</p>

<p>My heart began to beat, and Brusquet, putting
down his glass, stared at Carouges.</p>

<p>“Come, Carouges, you jest. Vibrac has escaped,
and all the other prisoners are free.”</p>

<p>“I see, my King of the Cap and Bells, that there
are some things that you do not know. Yes,
Marcilly has sinned against the Holy Office, and
he dies to-morrow on the Martroi, an hour after
sunrise.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and I strained
my ears to catch each word. Then Brusquet
asked:</p>

<p>“How do you know? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>Carouges shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p>“I command the guards at the scaffold,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>said. Whereupon the men became silent once
more, sipping their wine, and looking at one
another.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” said one. “What will come next?”</p>

<p>“A decree of the Court of Requests, granting
the forfeited lands of Chaumont and Duras to
that loyal servant of the King, that faithful shepherd
of his flock, Achon, Abbot of St. Savin,
Bishop of Arles, and Archbishop designate of
Sens.”</p>

<p>With that the jester rose as if to go, but Quesnay
pulled at his cloak.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said, “and give us a song&mdash;our
blood runs blue with this talk.”</p>

<p>But Brusquet shook his head, while his strange,
wrinkled face seemed to become more and more
sharp and acute, as he pointed in the direction
of the palace, where the dead King lay, and his
voice shook a little as he answered:</p>

<p>“Not to-night. There is some one lies there
who loved to listen to me, and who will listen
no more; but he is still too near for me to sing.”</p>

<p>So saying, he flung a couple of gold pieces on
the table, and, turning, stepped out of the room.
He was followed by the others. Outside I heard
their voices for a moment in laughing converse,
and then they were gone.</p>

<p>And I&mdash;I sat there, my head buried in my bosom
burning with remorse, half mad with the
tortures of memory. Marcilly was to die with
to-morrow’s light. The words seemed to hiss in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>my ears, and I&mdash;I had slain him with a Judas
kiss. Oh! I had got my revenge&mdash;but where was
its sweetness? I had plucked my Dead Sea fruit,
and the ashes of it were sere and bitter in my
mouth. I called for some Cognac, and sought to
obtain a temporary release from my mental tortures
in the disgraceful oblivion of the drunken;
but the fiery spirit had no more effect upon me
than if it had been water.</p>

<p>Sitting still became intolerable, so, paying my
account, I went out again into the night. I
sought the city gates once more, but they were
closed, and, with a curse, I turned and retraced
my steps. I was caged in Orleans for the night.
I again approached the cabaret, and stood hesitating
at the door. Then the thought of the conversation
I had overheard came upon me, and I
turned away and hastened onward, going I did
not know where&mdash;and, indeed, I cared not. With
the tireless persistence of a madman, I walked
for hours through street and square and alley.
I walked fast, seeking to weary myself, taking
no notice of anything, and must have made the
circuit of the city at least twice.</p>

<p>It was late now. The hum of voices, the bustle
of tramping feet had died away, and I was alone
on those gray roads, that stretched, wound,
turned, and twisted in all directions around me.
Above floated the moon in a cloudless sky, serene
and stately, and under its ivory light I plodded
on, feverish and tireless, until at last I came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>to a halt near the cloisters at the back of Ste.
Croix.</p>

<p>I looked about me. In that shivering light all
was silent and still. Pure and white above me
towered the temple of the Holy Rood, and to
the right the black mass of the palace loomed
against the sky, a phantom castle of cloudland.
From two windows of the keep lights were burning
like twin stars. It was there they kept the
death watch of the King. It was there that the
King’s Peace had come upon him, whose white
lips had offered it to us that night when we stood
by his bedside. For a space I watched the windows,
and then moved hastily onward. The
curse of Cain was upon me, and I could not rest.
But now my strength began to give way, and
the tremendous exertions of the past hours to
tell upon me. I held on, however, passing through
the labyrinth of streets beyond the cloisters, and
drew up once more, utterly tired out, on the edge
of a deserted and barren stretch of ground, covered
here and there with the castaway rubbish
of building materials. Across this waste was a
small row of ruined houses. They had been gutted
by fire, and the blackened and charred walls
stood starkly up before me. Here, at any rate,
was a refuge where I might lie securely till the
morning, and stepping across the field, I slunk
into the gaping doorway nearest to me, like a
wolf seeking his lair, and worn out and exhausted
sank down upon a heap of wreckage. But weary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>and broken though I was in body, my mind was
awake, and the eternal self-torment ceased not
for a moment. In my despair I dared to call
upon God to have mercy upon me and ease me
of my pain. I know not if that prayer ever
reached beyond the moonlight. For a while I
lay thus brooding, until my agony became once
more intolerable, and hunted me from my place
of rest. I rose on my elbow, when the sound of
a sliding footstep and the crumbling of stones
came to me, and I waited startled and expectant.
Who was this other wanderer of the night
that had sought the same dreary refuge as I had?
Again I heard the footstep, slow and stealthy,
but light withal. The noise came from within
the house, and whoever it was must have entered
before I had. Where I lay it was black shadow,
but streaming through the door was a bright
ribbon of moonlight, that stretched right in front
of me, and over which the new-comer would have
to pass. For a time there was a dead silence,
then there was another cautious step, then another,
and at last, with a light bound, a misshapen,
ape-like figure leaped into the moonlight
and stood glancing around. Strange and monstrous
indeed was the shape&mdash;the height that of
a child, the body that of a man. The long, black
muscular arms, reaching below the knees, were
bare. A tattered red cloak hung to his shoulders,
and his head, from which two yellow eyes
glared hideously, was bound up in a scarf that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>was wound round the jaws. For a breath I
thought it was some goblin of the night, some
evil spirit that stood before me in bodily presentment.
Then the thing made a strange, cackling
noise from its throat, and I knew it was Majolais.</p>

<p>And as I looked upon the dwarf a strange feeling,
it was almost gladness, came upon me.
Hideous, hardly human as he was, I had at least
found one whom I knew, one who, in his own
wild way, had shown a savage affection for me
for little kindnesses done.</p>

<p>“Majolais!” I cried softly.</p>

<p>The dwarf started. His eyes flashed as he
crouched backward, peering into the darkness,
and the moonlight played on the shining blade
of a dagger in his hand.</p>

<p>“Majolais! It is I&mdash;Vibrac,” and rising, I approached
him, but he had already recognized my
voice, and was at my feet, his frame trembling,
his poor, dumb throat choked with sobs.</p>

<p>I let the fit pass him, patting him gently on the
shoulder as if he were a dog, and for one brief
moment, in the thought of another’s sufferings,
I forgot my own. We sat down together on a
fallen rafter, where the moon fell brightly on us,
and I tried to talk to him and to get him to explain,
by signs if possible, how he had escaped
from Achon; but though he understood me he
could not explain to me. He unwound the scarf
to show me his mutilated head, and on his body
and upon his arms were the cruel welts of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>lash. These he showed me, moaning and gibbering,
and at each mention of Achon’s name he
snarled like a tiger-cat.</p>

<p>I sat on a fallen rafter, Majolais crouching at
my feet, and we talked for long. At least, I
spoke, and gathered what I could from his signs
and the broken sounds he made. At last the
moon sank and the dark hours came. The dwarf
drew the remnants of his cloak over his shoulders,
and, curling himself up like a dog, fell asleep.</p>

<p>But there came no rest for me, and with burning
eyes I sat staring through the darkness,
where the black shadows took the form and substance
of mocking devils, that flitted backward
and forward, gibing at my fall. I had lost all.
Wherever I went the shadow of my sin would
dog my footsteps. I had diced for my soul with
the fiend, and lost. Is there one who can win at
that game?</p>

<p>Death! Yes, death offered its release; but I
could not die by my own hand. It would set
the seal to my infamy; and then, there was another
life beyond the grave. I tried once more
to pray for health and strength, but a feeling I
could not restrain choked the words on my lips.
For very shame I could not pray. I could not
creep before God’s throne to ask back what I had
thrown away with both hands.</p>

<p>As I sat thus Majolais shivered and moaned.
Poor wretch! The cold struck him sorely, and
removing my cloak, I cast it over him while he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>slept. I then drew my doublet closer together,
and in doing so my fingers touched something
soft. I took hold of it, and the faint fragrance
of violets came to me. It was the remains of
the little offering Yvonne de Mailly had made to
me.</p>

<p>I removed the flowers and held them in my
hand. They were soft, delicate, and pure as the
girl’s heart&mdash;and I&mdash;I had cast aside a priceless
gem that lay at my feet, to wander after an elf-light
that led me into the deeps. I put the flowers
by carefully. They are with me to this day.
Sometimes I open my cabinet and look at them,
and as I gaze the withered blossoms seem to renew
their freshness, and their sweet scent to
come back to them. And then I shut them up
again reverently, as things too sacred for the
light.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, as I put aside the sad little
gift there flickered once more within me a faint
hope. A way was pointed to me to seek the
death that I craved. There was something of
honor in it. Yes, I would die by Marcilly’s side.
I could not save him; but I would try to, and
the clean sword that I wore would be used for the
first and the last time by me in a manner worthy
of its brightness. Strength came to me with the
thought; and feverish and impatient, I watched
the long hours steal past, until the time came for
me to go. I heard the Lauds, and although it
was still black darkness I could stay no longer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>Stooping down I shook Majolais by the shoulder.
He awoke with a gasp and a start, but recovered
himself at once, and, as I resumed my cloak, he
seized and kissed my hand, his hot lips burning
like a seal. I told him I was going, and that he
should, when it was light, seek the Princess of
Condé, there he would find rest and safety; but
Majolais clung to my cloak, and somehow made
me understand that he would not be parted from
me. So we two went out of our refuge.</p>

<p>Long and slow was our passage. We must
have wandered in the darkness like derelict ships,
but at last we reached the Martroi. The watch-fires
were burning, and here and there was the
gleam of a torch, or the flash of a light; for
early as was the hour, dark as it was, there were
those who had already assembled to see a fellow-creature
die.</p>

<p>Aided by the darkness, we approached near the
scaffold. Close to it were a series of wooden galleries,
and, drawing my sword, I slipped behind
one of these, and waited for the time to come&mdash;it
would not be long now&mdash;when I should die sword
in hand, and whiten, if only a little, my stained
shield.</p>

<p>Majolais was beside me when I took my place.
I saw his yellow eyes watching the sword, and,
as if he understood, he drew his dagger and felt
the point of it with his finger. But I had no intention
of sacrificing him. I whispered to him to
be gone. I told him in low, quick words what I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>meant to do; but he remained immovable. Finally,
I threatened him angrily, but to no purpose,
and I was about to resign myself to fate, when a
sudden idea seemed to possess him. He chuckled
like a night-jar, and, drawing himself up the
hoardings, he crept along them on all fours with
cat-like agility, and vanished in the darkness. I
was glad he was gone. He knew where to go for
safety, and this business of mine had to be done
alone.</p>

<p>And now the sky began to whiten, and night-fire
and torch to pale at the coming day. From
all hands there was a murmur and hum of voices.
Ghostly figures swarmed in the galleries, and the
tramp of feet echoed from every side of the square.
Slowly the day brightened, the hum and bustle
increased, while sometimes one heard a laugh or a
cry, a rough oath or a ribald jest, rise above the
buzz of voices.</p>

<p>The block was not ten paces from me, and on
the opposite side was a gallery, with a balcony
draped in velvet; but it was as yet unoccupied.
Suddenly there came the tramp of horses’ hoofs,
the clash of arms, a sharp order or two, and the
space round the scaffold was filled with armed
men, who were so close to me that, from where I
stood in concealment, I could have touched the
nearest with my hand. I heard Carouges’ voice,
and then a figure stepped from his side and
mounted the platform of the scaffold. It was a
masked man, robed all in black, with a long,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>two-handed sword over his shoulder. He stood
by the block, leaning on the cross-hilt of his sword,
and so absorbed was I in watching him, that I
fairly started as I felt a cold hand on mine, and
looking down beheld Majolais. I signed to him to
go, but for answer he pointed between the slits of
the boards toward the gallery opposite to us.
It was occupied now, and the malign countenance
that looked out thence upon the morning was
that of Achon. The dwarf’s face was like that of
a devil; and then he suddenly and swiftly backed
from me, and was gone once more. I leaned forward
and watched, and, as I did so, the faint
odor of something burning struck me. I glanced
behind, but could make out nothing, and my attention
was taken off by Carouges, as he spoke to
another who stood by his side, wrapped in a
long cloak.</p>

<p>“Are none of the Court coming? Is only he to
be here?” Carouges made a movement of his
hand toward Achon, and it was Richelieu who
answered him.</p>

<p>“Oh! There are many in the galleries, but no
royalties. They respect the dead King. However,
Monsieur of Arles, though he sits there
alone, is a host in himself.”</p>

<p>“Faith! If a host, he gives his guest a grewsome
banquet,” laughed the other, and then this
idle talk was interrupted by a murmur from the
crowd that swelled to a roar, and then died away
again in a death-like silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“He comes!” said Richelieu in a low voice, and
I tightened my grip on my sword, and measured
the distance for my rush to the scaffold.</p>

<p>The silence still continued. The crowd seemed
to be spellbound; and now the awful music of the
death hymn fell upon our ears, and all strained
forward, eager and expectant. Slowly the chant
came, nearer and yet more near, louder and
louder grew the solemn voices, and I could catch
each word of that song of praise to the Most
High, misused so blasphemously by those who
called themselves His priests:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quæso, Christe rex invicte,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tu succure misero,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sub extrema mortis hora</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Quum jussus abiero,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nullum in me jus tyranno</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Præbeatur impio.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I could hear the sad words but could see nothing,
except that Achon had arisen, his white
hands clasping the balustrade before him, and his
eyes peering downward in the direction of the
voices. He looked, as he stood, like some obscene
bird of prey watching for his quarry to come
within striking distance. There was a movement
among the soldiers, who parted to make room
for the doomed man, and then two by two the
mournful procession came into sight, the monks
before and behind the prisoner, chanting the last
verse of the hymn. As they passed the gallery beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
Achon they stopped for a moment, and he
leaned forward like a stooping vulture to look at
Marcilly, and at that moment the morning sun
came out in glorious light, and with it a fresh
breeze arose. The two, destroyer and victim,
faced each other, a smile of infernal malice on
Achon’s face, Marcilly pale, but calm and proud.
Then Achon made a slight gesture with his hand,
the procession moved onward, and I boldly
stepped out of my concealment, and stood behind
the soldiers. No one noticed me&mdash;all eyes were on
the man who was about to die.</p>

<p>They had reached the death platform by this,
the executioner had bowed to his victim, when
suddenly a roar of fright and horror burst from
the people, and dense volumes of smoke broke
out from the galleries. There was a wild shriek
of “Fire! Fire!” There was a rushing and
crowding of human beings like sheep. Achon
turned an alarmed face toward the galleries,
when, from beneath his own stand, a black cloud
of smoke came up, and the next instant the hangings
had caught fire, and he was enveloped in a
circle of flame. For a moment the execution was
stayed. The guard gathered round the prisoner,
hiding him from view; and Richelieu, springing
forward, attempted to scale the steps leading to
Achon’s gallery; but fell back beaten and baffled
by the smoke. The uproar was indescribable;
but through it all, my heart leaped as I heard the
rattle of drums, and they were&mdash;my God! they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>were beating the <i>Rappel d’Aunis</i>. But even as I
heard this, and others heard it too, we turned
our eyes to the burning gallery, where Achon was
alone. The sunlight hid the flames, but now and
then a warm orange flash showed where they
worked, and puffs of black smoke went up in long
spirals to the sky. The dry wood burnt merrily,
the breeze fanned the fire, and within his burning
cage Achon ran to and fro like a mad animal.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” he shrieked. “Oh, God! Help!”</p>

<p>They would have given it if they could. Even
I could not see him die like this, and, forcing my
way somehow through the crowd, I tried to face
the frail stairway, but ere I had gone four steps,
the charred wood broke, and I fell heavily. As I
rose to my feet, blackened and bruised, I saw
Marcilly was safe. It was but a glance I gave;
but it was enough, for Cipierre was beside him,
and the black uniforms of the gendarmes of Aunis
everywhere.</p>

<p>But for the moment all eyes were fixed on
Achon. There were other, and sadder, things going
on elsewhere in the burning square, for there
the innocent were dying with the guilty; but here,
where we were, this was what froze us with
horror, and moved us all to pity. Ay, pity!
Though he whom God’s hand was striking was
the worst of men.</p>

<p>As yet the flames had not touched him, but
leaped and danced around the wretch as though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>playing with him, as though they meant to let
him die mentally a hundred deaths before the end
came. Three times did he try to break through,
and three times we saw his face, evil, white, and
despairing, as he fell back, howling curses.</p>

<p>And now there was a yell of horror from those
around us, horror and terror unspeakable, and a
monk, one of those who sang the death hymn,
cried out in a voice that rose shrill and high:</p>

<p>“’Tis the devil! The devil come for him!”</p>

<p>Achon had again dashed to the flaming balustrade,
but this time not alone. A black, misshapen
thing was at his side, and two long black
arms were wound round his neck. He struggled
and cried out in a broken voice, and his glazed
eyes shone with an awful terror, as he looked at
the hideous face pressing close to his. Down they
fell together, backward, to reappear again after
a breathless movement. They strove madly together.
They were hardly human. So closely
were they clenched, so grimed were they both by
the smoke, that it was barely possible to distinguish
the one from the other, and as they came
to the edge of the balcony, where the burning
balustrade had dropped away, their limbs writhed
and worked, like that of some monstrous spider
in an agony.</p>

<p>Beneath them was a hissing, seething pit of
flame, and, balancing on that perilous ledge, they
fought together mutely. Long arms of fire shot
up to them from the blazing deep below, seeking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>to clutch them and drag them down, but still
they fought for the life that was already lost to
both. For one brief moment I caught Achon’s
glance, and it froze me to stone, for he was looking
through me, and the terror of that which lies
beyond the grave, and who knows what besides,
glared from his eyes.</p>

<p>No one spoke. No one stirred, but all watched
and watched for the end. At last it came. For a
breath the frightful pair swayed and tottered together
backward and forward, and then&mdash;fell,
locked in their death-grip, into the flames beneath.</p>

<p>A shuddering cry went up from the crowd, and
then all was still. Once we saw the dwarf, a dim
figure, rise through the flames, and wave an arm
wildly, and then he vanished in the roaring fire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My tale is done. It is not for me to tell the
history of the time, or to relate how the coming
of the Constable gave a breath of peace to my
afflicted land. It is sufficient for me to say that,
after the death of Achon, the one enemy who
would have troubled to harm me was removed.
As for the others, those whom I had betrayed to
their death, and whom God saved from their peril,
they let me drop into oblivion. Here to my own
halls of Vibrac did I return. Here have I hidden
my shame. Here have I learned to repent. Who
shall know the hours of agony, the days, the
years of penitence and bitter remorse that I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>passed? No man! But there is One who knows,
One at whose feet I have knelt and humbled myself
with tears of blood; and He who despised
not the thief on the Cross will, perhaps, have
mercy upon a broken and a contrite heart.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
